Woodson's plan in relation to the general problem of the\n      \n\n        Joint Committee on materials for research.\n\nThe Committee will probably be called upon to evaluate three\nkinds of needs:\n\n1) The need for the accomplishment of a definite research\n      \n\n        task. Some research work, urgently needed for practical\nreasons, or because of its strategic place in research\ngenerally, cannot be done without making a special collection\nof material. The financing of such collecting should be\ndependent upon the financing of the research project itself --\n(as with the Law Enforcement Commission).\n\nOur Committee may interest itself in these projects to the\nextent that it may be possible to secure permanent archives\nas a by-product thereof, but the evaluation or endorsement\nof projects on this basis is evidently not for us.\n\n2) The need for the organising of materials. Some fields\nof research may be entirely neglected, or others inadequately\nworked, because the material is scattered, uncatalogued,\nunknown, although safe and accessible. This work can be done\npartly by bringing together materials now separated, (as the\nLibrary of Congress copies foreign archives) or listing\naccessible material in scattered depositories, as the Wilson\nCompany is doing with Government Document lists.\n\n3) The need for protection of materials from total loss.\nSome material of value for research is in danger of ir~\nreparable loss because of the (1) physicsl decomposition of\nthe paper upon which it is written, (2) the death of witnesses\nwho leave no written testimony, (3) the acts of custodians\nwho lose or destroy papers or any articles of value in\nscholarly research (burning of old papers, junking of old\nmachinery, etc. ).\n\nThe protection of research materials from this type of\nloss has two aspects: (1) the organizing of the custodianship\nof contemporary materials for preservation for the future\n(collection of ephemeral printed matter by local libraries);\n(2) the collecting of \"old papers\" or other items which are\nin the hands Of individual owners, and their safe deposit\nin libraries, archives or museums.\n\nMr. Woodson's project falls into two of these divisions:\nit involves partly the accumulating of material which is\nin danger of loss because of faulty custodianship, and\npartly the organizing of material which is in no danger of\ndestruction but which is relatively scattered and in~\naccessible.\n\nII. Survey of the fields and agencies for the collection of\n      \n\n        manuscript material.\n\nAs a basis for the endorsement or non endorsement of\nWoodson's project, we are asked to formulate an appraisal\nof the various fields for the collection of manuscript\nmaterial. I take it that this appraisal is to apply only\nto the type of material which is threatened with loss\nbecause of its custodianship, and not with the organizing\nor copying of materials already in the safe custody of\nlibraries, archives or other institutions.\n\nTo set this problem before ourselves in its entirety we\nmust take account of three elements: the present possessors\nof material, the types of material, the agencies of collect~\nion and deposit.\n\n1) The possessors whom it is desired to reach. Most owners\nwhom it might be desireable to reach regard papers in their\npossession simply as \"old papers\" which they value for\nreasons quite foreign to those which excite the interest of\nthe scholar. From the standpoint of the owner, the class~\nifications into such subheads as \"economic\", \"political\",\n\"literary remains\" etc., are of little significance. There~\nfore an estimate of the fields in which material is to be\ngathered must classify not only types of material, but types\nof owners from whom material of any or all kinds is to be\nsought.\n\nThe following types of owners would appear to be most\nimportant: --\n\na) Old families, long resident in the same locality, in\npossession of a home in which papers have accumulated by\naccident and accretion.\n\nb) People who treasure the papers left by some more or\nless distinguished ancestor or relative.\n\nc) Business houses to which old papers are simply \"dead\nfiles\", often sacrificed because of the cost of storage space.\n\nd) It may be true that negroes and immigrants, for\nthe reasons cited in Woodson's letter, and in a way\nexemplified in Thomas and Zusnecki's study of the Polish\npeasant, are the custodians of materials which should be\ncollected.\n\nThese old papers suffer a special danger of loss or\ndestruction every time their owner moves, and this risk\nis especially high when the owners are poor, or when the\nmaterial is stored in places where space is at a premium.\n\n2) Field to be covered, by subject matter. The Committee\non Problems and Policy realizes, of course, that an\nappraisal by subject matter of the materials which research\nworkers in all fields will wish to have preserved will be\nlargely based on guess and audacity. In a general way, one\ncould say that a sampling of everything committed to writing\nshould find its way to some institution which will preserve\nit for the future.\n\nThe basic generalized source of information on our life\nis of course newspaper. Beyond that the following list\nof subjects is not too comprehensive for the total program\nof manuscript collection, taken as a local as well as a\nnational program, and covering all periods, including the\ncontemporary.\n\nEconomic:\n\nSome business records of every important local\nindustry. Correspondence of business men and\nlabor leaders. Corporation archives.\n\nSocial:\n\nFamily or personal letters, or love letters,\nrepresentative of different levels of groups of\nsociety, at different periods, -- (farmers,\nimmigrants, negroes, local aristocracy, etc.\n\nArt -- Literature -- Music:\n\nTheature and musical programs\nLiterary remains of local writers\n\nEducation:\n\nSchool records\nSamples of school essays, copybooks, etc.\n\nPolitical:\n\nAddresses of political groups or societies\nCorrespondence of political leaders\n\nReligion:\n\nSermons and church account books\n\n3) Agencies and institutions for collection and deposit.\nInstitutions and agencies already in existence, and living\non their own budgets, already cover much of this collecting\nfield. Some of these institutions may be lacking in industry\nin collecting material, others may fail to appreciate the\nvalue of material accessible to them because they view their\ntask too narrowly. The survey undertaken by the Committee\nwill help to make it possible to estimate how far existing\ninstitutions are insufficient, what types of material are\nnot being collected, what categories of possessors of manu~\nscripts are not being approached. Probably the only adequate\ncoverage of the field of manuscript collecting will be\nworked out in terms of institutions rather than projects.\n\nThe following types of collecting institutions or agencies\nseem to have outstanding importance in a general survey:\n\na) Public archives or libraries, historical societies,\nresearch institutes, etc. The only point to be made here\nis with respect to the adequate assumption by these institut~\nions of responsibility for collecting and storing manuscript\nmaterial, and the rational apportionment of the work.\n\nb) The private collector. From the standpoint of larger\nstrategy his place is peculiar. When he has made his\ncollection he has already rescued the material from careless\ndestruction. By purchasing it from him and depositing it in\npublic institutions we are rendering it more useful and\nsafer. Moreover, we are establishing a market value for\ncollections which may halt the careless destruction of\ndocuments. But since many private collections, having\noccupied the interest of their owner during his lifetime,\nfind their way to some public or institutional place of\ndeposit without cost, and other private collections are\naccessible to students during the lifetime of the owners,\nthe purchase of a private collection does not have the same\nkind of importance as the acquisition of manuscripts from\nsome casual owner.\n\nc) The corporation, industrial and professional\norganizations in whose records we are interested.\n\nThese may be widened to take more of the scholar's\nattitude toward the preservation of their own records, and\nto extend their interest even to the accumuluation of other\nmaterials relating to their activiites. Every industry\nand labor groups has its national organization. There is\nneed in the general plan for the assumption of archive\nresponsibilities by these bodies themselves. Great corp~\norations to have Record Offices like governments; big\nsteel men to found archives on the steel industry, etc.\n\n4) Application to Mr. Woodson's project. Since Mr. Woodson's\nrequest relates to a project rather than an institution, we\nare justified in basing recommendation, not upon an appraisal\nof the entire field of manuscript collection, but upon a\nspeculative estimate of the extent to which special approp~\nriations from the reserve resources of scholarship are\nwanted for special projects, or new financial undertakings\nfrom outside are necessary.\n\nThe need for special projects sponsored by the general\nrepresentatives of scholarship arises especially:\n\na) When the group involved lacks leadership or the\nsocial and financial resources necessary for the preservation\nof its own records. The Hereditary Patriotic and Historical\nSocieties take care of the records and papers of prominent\nstatesmen or well established families. Negroes and immi~\ngrants are at once more likely to lose their papers, and less\nwell provided with institutions for caring for them.\n\nb) When a kind of collecting has been long neglected,\nso that some special effort is needed, after which the ordinary\ninstitution can continue the collecting of material in the\nordinary way, by casual gift, bequest, etc.\n\nc) A special case of neglect is that of the material not\ngenerally understood to have historical importance, and hence\nleft out of account in the organization of the archives of\ncivilization. Business records are a case in point. (In\nthis case funds for acquisition projects should be sought from\nbusiness itself.)\n\nd) After the survey of existing archives and agencies\nof collection is complete, regional and topical lacunae in\nthe existing set-up will appear. These will have to be filled\n\n\nin, and where special sources of support cannot be tapped,\nappeal must be made to the general funds of scholarship.\n\nMr. Woodson's project claims endorsement under heads\na and b.\n\nIII. Principles under which an endorsement of Woodson's project\n      \n\n        can be based.\n\nWoodson's project, seen in its relation to the total\nfield of interest of the Committee, occupies a small but\ndefinite place. But not all parts of the project are\nequally valuable from the standpoint of larger strategy. \n\nThat part of the project which involves the copying of\nmaterial from State and foreign archives is of secondary\nimportance. It comes within that part of our field of\ninterest which relates to the organizing of information\nabout existing archives, and the classifying of materials\nalready safely deposited. It is not clear that Woodson's\nproject works out the whole problem of the organization of\narchive materials on negro history. Certainly one cannot\ndo a thorough job in the European archives with the funds\nhere requested, to say nothing of the State Archives! The\njob of copying from archives, if done at all, should be\ndone with the degree of thoroughness that characterizes\nthe photographing of foreign archives now going on under\nthe direction of the L.C. Manuscript Division. If Dr.\nJameson thinks this plan will do as thorough a job, I\nwould favor endorsing it, though not regarding it as\nurgent in the same degree as the other part of Woodson's\nproject. Archive materials are at least safe where they\nare.\n\nThat part of the project which involves the securing of\noriginals or copies of manuscripts from negro families\nseems to me to be of the highest importance, because this\nis the material most likely to be lost, and because an\neffort in this direction may have permanent after-effects\nin stimulating further enterprises of collecting by the\nnegroes themselves.\n\nIn recommending the use of money for this purpose we\nshould be able to give assurance that the best methods of\ncollecting are being used, and the most appropriate de~\n\npository selected. \n\nAs to methods of collection, I hope that those in charge \nof the research project will not take too great pains to \nget originals when they can get photostat copies, and that \nthey will look into the method of copying archives used \nby Martin in the manuscript division of the Library of \nCongress. It will be much easier to get permission to \nphotograph diaries, papers, etc., than to walk off with \nthe papers themselves.\n\nAs to the place of deposit, the Library of Congress has \nthe advantage -- a very great one from the standpoint of \nthe man who is begging gifts -- that it is a national \npublic institution. Even if its collection on negro \nhistory is less complete than that which is to be found \nelsewhere, I would reoommend that it be chosen as the \ndepository. \n\n\n        Conclusion. \n\nIf the maximum responsibility to be taken in endorsing \na project would be, following Dr. Wilson's formula \"to \nsay that this is not only a good project but a highly \nstrategic project, and requests a sum of money entirely \nseasonable in view of its importance,\" we need not assume \nthis responsibility except in exceptional cases. \n\nA lesser degree of responsibility in endorsement would \nbe more easily given. We can say of a project for the \ncollection of material \n\n1) That it fits in with the general plan \n2) That it does not duplicate the work of any other agency equally or better equipped to do it. \n3) That the means proposed are adapted to the end. \n4) That the end itself is highly desirable. \n\nThat part of Woodson's project which has to do with the \nsearch for documents among American negroes, is worth this \nsecond kind of endorsement. Of the search for materials \nin the archives I am not sure that we can approve it under \npoint 2, for there may lie other agencies better equipped\nfor doing this work.\n\nRobert C. Binkley\n\n18 July, 1930.\n\n\n"

    "text": "\n\nFUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF RESULTS OF RESEARCH.\n\nBy Robert C. Binkley\n\nJoint Committee on Materials for Research\n\nI.\n\nA typescript thesis is a \"rare book\". From the standpoint of\nlibrary administration it is nothing else. Micro-copying that\nwill make rare books available will make typescript theses avail~\nable to whomsoever wants them.\n\nThe special problem in making these theses available to\nusers is no longer mechanical, but has to do with bibliographical\nlisting. If a unique copy of a book is deposited in any library\nhaving micro-copying equipment, it becomes available to any li~\nbrary or person having micro-reading equipment.\n\nTo the extent that micro-reading equipment becomes a part of\nnormal library equipment, micro-copying will make theses available.\nIt cannot be anticipated that libraries will install this equip~\nment for the sole purpose of making it possible to use deposited\ntheses. The installation is likely to come about because micro-\ncopying and the reading of micro-copies meet other library problems.\n\nII.\u00a0\n\nIf the thesis, or other product of research, is to be multi~\nplied in book form, the cost of multiplying it may be assessed\nagainst author, or against the library or person who acquires the\nbook, or distributed between them.\n\nIf the author bears the whole cost of multiplying the book\nand distributes it free of charge to libraries, no act of ap~\npraisal of the book is necessary except that which the receivers of the book will perform in deciding whether to shelve the gift\u00a0\nor put it in the waste basket.\n\nIf the people who are to acquire the book are to be asked to\u00a0\ncontribute toward the cost of multiplying it, the work of ap~\npraising must precede their decision to assume part of the cost\nof multiplying.\n\nAt present this appraising is done in two ways. The most\ncommon is that used in the publishing trade. An editor appraises\na manuscript and makes a decision to publish; then reviewers step\nin, and on the basis of their reviews purchasers make there decision.\n\nSometimes the editors assume so much responsibility, as in\nbringing out a series, that the purchasers do no await the second\nappraisal made by reviewers. This is the second of the two systems\nnow in use.\n\n\nThese methods do not place a large proportion of the cost on\nthe purchasers of books; the author of a Ph.D, dissertation bears\nmost of the cost.\n\nBoth of these methods of appraising books and distributing\ntheir cost between authors and buyers leave a large margin of risk.\nWhile they have been developed in connection with the technique of\nprinting, they are not necessarily tied to that technique.\n\nA third arrangement would be possible. The appraising of the\nbook could be made, not only prior to the multiplying of it, but\nprior even to the distribution of its cost between author and\npurchasers. This is the system proposed in a memorandum of the\nJoint Committee on a publishing service. Under this scheme, the\namount contributed by the purchasers for each copy, and by the\nauthor toward the whole edition, would be calculated after a circu~\nlarization of possible purchasers had measured the demand.\n\nIII.\n\nThere are two functions in connection with the distribution of\nthe results of research which are more intellectual than mechanical.\nThe first is the entering of information regarding the research\nproduct in bibliographical guides; the second is the appraising of\nthe merit of the research product. This work is done by professional\nscholars, who may or may not be remunerated for it.\n\nThe two functions are related. A bibliographical entry implies\na degree of appraisal; at least the research product must be assumed\nto relate to the topic under which it is entered. This amount of\nappraising can be left to the author or, in the case of Ph.D. theses,\nto those under whom the work was done.\n\nThe more complete appraising that is necessary before asking\npurchasers to contribute toward the cost of multiplying a book is\nnot so properly left to the author or his adviser.\n\nIV.\n\nNo matter what techniques of reproduction are used in multi~\nplying a text, these problems of appraisal and assessment of cost\narise.\n\nThe rational use of these available techniques requires, however,\nthat the intellectual elements of the distributing process, namely\nbibliographical entry and appraisal, should be made available re~\ngardless of the technique of multiplying.\n\nV.\n\nThe cost levels of various techniques are approximately as\nfollows:\n\nA. Typescript with carbon copies. This cost is always as~\nsessed against the author in its entirety. If it is accompanied\n\nby deposit in a library offering micro-copying service, micro-\ncopies become available to readers at a cost varying from 25\u00a2\nto $1.50 per hundred pages. These prices are available at the\npresent time; they may be lowered.\n\nB. Multiplying by the hectograph, with one or two copies\nmade with permanent record ribbon or carbon, and fifty to a\nhundred in methyl violet hectograph ink. This process will\ncost the author three or four times as much as the cost of mak~\ning his typescript as described above, not taking into account\ncosts of binding.\n\nC. Multiplying with mimeograph. In this case the copies\nwill all be in permanent ink. The cost for a hundred copies\nwill be five to six times as much as the cost of the typescript\nand carbon, and will begin to approach the cost level of the\nphoto-offset technique.\n\nD. Multiplying with photo-offset. The cost of this pro~\ncess approaches, and in some cases, passes that of the cheap~\nest printing techniques.\n\nE. Printing. The manufacturing costs of a printed book\nare usually calculated to include a number of other costs,\nnotably those of appraisal and sale, because this technique\nis associated with an effort to secure contributions toward\nthe cost from purchasers.\n\n\n"

    "text": "\n\n\n        MEMORANDUM ON THE MAKING OF BOOKS AS PART OF WPA PROJECTS\n      \n\nA commercial book manufacturing business has never entered and\ncannot enter the domain of small-edition publishing, where 50-200\n\n        copies of a given\u00a0volume are required. Yet this is precisely the\n\n        zone in \n        cuments and writings of local interest should be pub~\n\n        lished.\u00a0The reason for the failure of private industry to enter this\n\n        field is\u00a0the high labor cost ratio to the materials and equipment cost\nin small-edition and Publishing. This fact marks out the domain as one\n\n        which WPA can command.\u00a0\n      \n\nWPA can manufacture books by four near-print processes: namely,\nhectograph, mimeograph, multilith, and multigraph. A unit of 50\nman years will produce in editions of 50-100\u00a0copies the following ap~\n      \nproximate number of words:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n| | words: | pages: |\n| hectograph: | 60,000,000 | 150,000 | 30,000 pages per man year |\n| mimeograph: | 50,000,000 | 125,000 | 2500 pages per man year |\n| multigraph: | 10,000,000 | \n        25,000| 500 pages per man-year |\n\nThese pages can be produced with less than 10% of the project\ninvested in equipment and materials. The multigraph resembles print\nand is to be favored for editions above 100; hectograph and mimeograph\nfor editions of 50-100.\n\nAt $850 per man year, the cost of books produced by anyone of\nthese processes is approximately $42,000. Private industry produc~\ning books in larger editions counts on a manufacturing cost of three\nto four dollars per page for printing; the multigraph books are pro~\nduced at this cost per page (though the size of edition is naturally\nsmaller). The production of large-scale hectograph and mimeograph\nwork is not standardized as to prices in private industry, but cer~\ntain clues are available. The NRA and AAA records were offered in\nmimeograph and hectograph form to libraries at two cents a page, and\nto commercial buyers at ten cents a page. Hence, an edition of 50\nat these prices would have been sold for a gross price of five dollars\nper page at the higher rate, and one dollar per page at the lower\nrate. Figuring at the lower rate, WPA can produce these books at\nless then the lowest selling price established by the services which\nsold copies of the NRA hearings. But thesa prices were themselves\nso out of line with library purchasing power that no sales were ac~\ntually made, although the libraries desired copies.\n\nThis proves that there is a gap in the production of small ed~\nitions of near-print volumes which private industry does not meet,\nand WPA work in producing volumes of this class would not be competi~\ntive with private industry.\n\nIt is believed, though details have not been worked out, that\nvolumes manufactured by WPA can be bound by rapidly-trained WPA\nhand labor, and thus furnished in completed form to public institu~\ntions and libraries.\n\nII. The types of books that can be made in this fashion are (a)\nthe editions of the Federal Writers' Projects, where publication in\nlarge editions from other sources has not appeared, (b) the pro~\n\n        ducts of the survey\u00a0of federal archives and the Historical Records\n\n        Survey, (c) the newspaper digest, (d) compilation of material from\n\n        unpublished archives, etc.\u00a0(e) translations of books which would not\n\n        sustain commercial\u00a0publication in translation form (it is believed\n\n        that a team of two workers, one of whom knows a foreign language\n\n        well. and the English language moderately well, the other of whom is\n\n        well versed in English and has a smattering of the foreign language,\n\n        can translate\u00a0competently foreign language books which do not depend\n\n        for their value\u00a0on Iiterary style. Such books are those in the\nfields of social science and history). There is no limit to the\nnumber of sound books not available in English, which would make\nvaluable additions to the research libraries of the country if they\nwere available in a limited edition translated.\n\nIII. Labor: where skilled typist labor is not available, literate\nunskilled workers can be trained rapidly to use the multigraph.\n\nRobert C. Binkley\nMay 11, 1936\n\n\n"

    "text": "\n\nMEMORANDUM ON FUTURE PLANS FOR FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECTS\n\nJune 10, 1936\n\n1) Mimeograph or other near-print reproduction: The writers should\nbe assured that their product will be multiplied and not lost view as\nsimple typescript. Since printing is inaccessible with most of their\nproduct, mimeograph must suffice. Materials cost in editions of 100 for\nwax stencil mimeographing is only $.09\u00bd a page (including cost of sten~\ncil, ink, and copy paper). The project can reproduce and distribute to\nlibraries in usable form everything that is written. This will give the\nlibrarians, who have been helping in the preparation of the American\nGuide, a tangible gift.\n\n2) The prospect of mimeographing or other near-print reproduction\nmakes possible a new slant on the type of work to be done. The writers\ncan now concentrate on bringing new facts to light. Hitherto they have\nbeen in general selectors fron among the facts now available. They\nhave worked at the level of popularization for widespread publication.\nIn their new work, in which they will issue in limited editions, their\naim should be to add new information from hitherto unused sources to\nthe stock of information that is now available in libraries.\n\n3) Concretely, this would mean that they would work as far as pos~\nsible from archives, old newspapers, and manuscripts, in preparation of\nlocal histories. Most \"county histories\" are notoriously shallow. The\nFederal Writers would do nothing of value if they rewrite material from\ncounty histories. They should be warned specifically, \"keep away from\nthe county histories\". They should seek to avoid as much as possible\nthe inclusion in their own writings of material that already is available\nin book form. Let them go to the original sources. Better bring to\nlight a series of interesting facts hitherto unknown than to make a\nrearrangement of known material.\n\n4) The bibliographical work of the Guide (so far as I have observed\nit) has quite properly been built upon existing library catalogue ser~\nvices, reference services, etc. In the new program, the Federal Writers\nshould be in a position to add to local bibliography a great bulk of\ninformation not now in the hands of the librarians. Specifically, they\ncan go through the periodical literature of America, notably the tech~\nnical, trade, labor, and religious publications and note all localized\nmaterial. Through the national organization, the localized bibliograph~\nical entries can be cleared and put in the possession of the district\nsupervisors. One issue of the Inland Printer will have articles about\nbusiness in a dozen different cities. Each of these articles showld be\nnoted and evaluated and brought to the files of the Federal Writers man\nin the city or town named. A comprehensive list of American periodicals\ncan be copied and farmed out among the writers. For certain periodical\ntitles, the Wilson Union List of Periodicals in American Libraries will\nserve as a guide. But an important class of trade, technical, and re~\nligious publications are not entered in Wilson's Union List. For those\na supplementary list must be made.\n\n5) For many librarians have been asking for a revision of\nLarned's \"Literature of American History\", which was compiled about 1900\nand is much out of date.\u00a0 Under CWA and FERA, Dr. Louis Hacker, a very\ncompetent American scholar in New York, supervised the first steps of\nthe preparation of such an edition. With a corps of workers, he went\nthrough learned and semi-learned, scholarly and semi-scholarly period~\ndical literature, making abstracts of reviews of books on American history.\nHe planned tht bibliography to present the broadest conception of his~\ntory, as inclusive of such subjects as labor, culture, etc. Forty\nthousand cards were made and brought together when the work was stopped.\nIt had to be given up because the New York Public Library had reached\nthe limit of its ability to give space and materials for the task.\nThis task is a challenge to the highest abilities in the Writers' Pro~\nject. Its successful completion will require the utmost critical acu~\nmen, power of selection, knowledge of intellectual currents of the day.\nIt is not in any sense of the word a clerical task. I think a super~\nvisory committee of scholars could be appointed, and I think you could\narrange with Dr. Hacker to have him take a hand, and I am absolutely\ncertain that if Federal Writers in the course of the next year could\ncompile this revision, this new comprehensive national bibliography,\nthey would earn the gratitude of every librarian in the country. The\nAmerican Library Association would publish it. The librarians have\nbeen of great assistance to the Federal Writers in the past; this would\nbe a return favor of no small magnitude. I hope that you can take it on.\n\n6) As to newspapers, I think the work of indexing, digesting, and\ncalendaring them should at this time be experimental with a none-too-\nhigh standardization technique. Nobody in the country really knows the\nbest way of overcoming the difficulties in the use of newspaper mater~\nial, -- the difficulties that derive from their vast extent and heteroge~\nneous character. I should be very glad to send you some copies of the\nmanual on making a newspaper digest, which records the result of experi~\nence in Cleveland, and I hope that a number of experiments on different\nscales will be made throughout the country during the coming year, by\nthe Federal Writers in some cases, by local project sponsors in others.\n\nRobert C.

    "text": "\n\nMemorandum on the Present State of Photographic\nCopying on Micro Film, with Special Reference to\nthe Problems of W.P.A.\n\nIn the past five years experiments have been\nin progress in the copying of books, typescripts, newspapers,\nand magazine articles on moving picture film. The essential\nidea is that reading matter can be reduced many diameters on\ntranslucent film and then read indirectly by projected images\non  screen in a special reading machine.\n\nThe price of the cin\u00e9-positive film on a\nsafety base is $.01\u00bd a foot for 35mm. film (the full size for\nprofessional movies), and $.0075 a foot for 16mm. film (the\nkind usually used in amateur movies). Since reading matter\ncan be reduced sixteen diameters and read effectively by pro~\njection, eight pages of a newspaper can be photographed on\none foot of 35mm. film, and sixteen pages of typescript on\none foot of 16mm. film. When films are made in large quan~\ntities, the processing costs can be brought very low.\n\nThe largest experiment made so far in using\nthis process as a substitute for printing or mimeographing has\nbeen the copying of the hearings of the N.R.A. and A.A.A. Over\n300,000 typescript pages were copied and distributed to twelve\nlibraries, each of whioh bought a set. The price to each li~\nbrary was at the rate of about $.12 per 100 pages of micro~\ncopied typescript.\n\nThe Bibliofilm Service, operating in the li~\nbrary of the Department of Agriculture, offers to copy any\narticle from any of its periodicals at a basic price of $.01 a\npage. In Cleveland and in Philadelphia, union catalogues are\nbeing made by a procedure that utilizes the micro-copying pro~\ncess. The author cards from all libraries in the vicinity are\ncopied very rapidly on film and then typed from the reading ma~\nchine. This procedure permits the making of a union catalogue\n\nwithout disturbing the ordinary routine of a library. The net\ncost per typed card for the filming, materials, labor of typing\nand rental of equipment is less than $.03 in Cleveland.\n\nIn Boston and in Cleveland, W.P.A. projects\nhave been prepared to provide for the photographing of news~\npaper files. Since newspaper files of the last sixty years have\nbeen printed on wood pulp paper, they are doomed to certain\ndestruction by sheer chemical disintegration. If copies of the\nfiles are made on microscopic film, the newspaper record will\nbe preserved. The Bureau of Standards conducted a study of the\nstability of safety film and reported in January, 1936, that\ncellulose acetate film has every prospect of full permanence\nequal to that of the best rag paper.\n\nAnother field for micro-copying is in the col~\nlection of manuscript materials. A number of scholars have\ntaken small micro-copying cameras to Europe with them. One man\nbrought back 80,000 documents after a summer's work. In the\ncollection of historical records, it will sometimes happen\nthat the owner of a manuscript is willing to have a copy made,\nbut unwilling to part with the original. In such cases, the\nmicro-copying technique will permit very cheap and rapid copy~\ning without inconvenience to the holder.\n\nThese micro-copies are white-on-black negatives.\nThey can be read by projection without being enlarged. Moreover\npositive copies can be made directly from them at the same cost\nper foot of film as the original film plus processing costs.\nIf full-size paper copies are desired, they can be enlarged or\n\"blown-up\" to any size on ordinary photostat paper with an or~\ndinary enlarging apparatus. The surprising thing about micro-\ncopying is the low material cost involved. Most people have\nhitherto associated photography with a rather high cost of film,\nplant, or photostat paper. In microphotographic work, the ma~\nterials cost is so low that it becomes almost negligible in\ncomparison with labor cost.\n\nThe equipment for micro-copying is developing\nvery rapidly. Until recently most people who used 35mm. film\neither adapted an old moving picture camera or used the Leica,\n a small German camera, or its relative, the Zeiss Contax camera.\nThese cameras are excellent from every point of view for a\nvariety of uses, but they have three disadvantages in document\ncopying: 1) they require a number of accessories to adapt them\nto document copying; 2) they include many expensive structural\nelements which are not necessary in document copying; 3) they\nuse a roll of film only five feet long. (There is a special\nLeica camera which uses  a thirty-foot roll). The short roll of\nfilm increases the labor of reloading and processing the film,\nalso the difficulty of filing the film after it is processed.\n\nCameras adapted specifically for the purpose of\nmicro-copying appeared in the hands of certain inventors\nwho were doing title abstract work -- especially Lambach and Ken~\nnedy. Then a subsidiary of the Eastman Kodak Company, the Re~\ncordak Corporatio of 350 Madison Avenue, New York, devised an\nautomatic camera to copy bank checks on l6mm. film, and a reading\nmachine to read the film record. The Recordak is a very rapid \nand foolproof machine about the size of an ordinary small desk. \nIt is the machine that was used in copying the N.R.A. and A.A.A.\nhearings and in the union catalague work. The Recordak Corpora~ \ntion has recently built a larger machine to copy unbound news~ \npapers. With this machine they are making copies of the current\nfiles of a number of newspapers for the sake of preserving them\u00a0 \nand diminishing storage costs. They also copied the full file \nof the New York Times for 1914-18, a period in which the origi~\nnal newspaper file was so very heavily used that it was rapidly\nwearing out. The Recordak Corporation then undertook to design\na camera for copying bound books. They now have two bound-book\ncopying cameras that are highly automatic: 1) for copying or~\ndinary books on 16mm. film; 2) for copying newspapers on 35mm.\nfilm. The Bureau of the Census has just spent $60,000 to equip\nitself with a full set of photographic machinery of this type.\nThe Eastman Company, through the Recordak Corporation, secured\nthe contract. \n\nThe Recordak Corporation has also adapted its\nprojector, which was originally invented to take care of the\nneeds of banks that used check-copying machines, to micro-copying,\nand they now offer a library projector which will handle micro~\ncopies of newspapers. Two hundred of these library newspaper-\nreading Recordak projectors are now in the course of manufacture.\nThey will sell for around $200. Another company has been devel~\noping micro-film reading apparatus, and though it has not put\nanything on the market to date it will be ready within a few\nmonths with a reading machine that will sell for about $80. This\ncompany, the International Filmbook Corporation, Rockefeller\nCenter, New York City, expects to go into large-scale mass pro~\nduction and may ultimately bring the price of its reading equip-\nment well below the $80 figure. A third manufacture who is en~\ntering this field is the Folmer Graflex Corporation of Rochester,\nNew York. For two years this company has been working on a\nportable automatic copying camera which will rapidly and accurate~\nly photograph on 16mm. and 35mm. film and on 70mm. paper. The\nPhoto Record camera will sell for a little over $200 and will\nbe available on January 1, 1937 or before. It has been subjected\nto constant criticism by persons experienced in the problems of\ndocument photography and will be probably the best general utility\ncamera in document work. Another set of apparatus has been de~\nsigned by Dr. Draeger, who has worked in conjunction with Dr.\nWatson Davis of Science Service, 2101 Constitution Avenue, Wash~\nington, D.C., and with Bibliofilm Service in the library of the\nDepartment of Agriculture. Dr. Draeger has designed several\ncameras, none of which are as yet available on the open market.\n\nHe has also designed a reading machine which is about to enter\nproduction. Mr. Lloyd B. Kennedy of Warren, Ohio, after being\ninformed of the problem of W.P.A. photography, undertook to\ndesign an inexpensive but accurate camera for micro-copying of\nnewspapers. He can produce this camera, together with a carriage\nto hold the newspapers and a system of lights, for about $200 per\ncamera.\n\nThose who have been studying the applications\nof microphotography are agreed that it has now passed the ex~\nperimental stage and has become important in the practical plan~\nning of work in archives, manuscripts, and newspapers. It may\nturn out to have special advantages in the current phase of\nW.P.A. activities, because it affords perfect accuracy of trans~\ncription and low materials costs compared with other kinds of\nphotography. \n\nThe union catalogue projects in Philadelphia\nand Cleveland demonstrate another quality of microphotography in\nrelation to W.P.A. problems. With microphotography, documents\nwhich are to be worked up, statistical materials which are to\nbe broken down, or records which are to be copied in typescript\nor cards can be taken rapidly from their places of deposit with~\nout inconvenience to the custodians and brought together in a\nworkroom where large bodies of people can be organized under\nfactory routine, with reading machines and typewriters or pads\nof paper, to transmit the materials, rearrange them, index them,\nor subject them to any type of statistical breakdown.\n\nThe use of microphotography in multiplying the\nN.R.A. and A.A.A. hearings proves, moreover, that certain types\nof material, when put into good and usable form in a filing\ncase, can be \"published\" in a sense for a price of $.12 per 100\npages.\n\nRobert C. Binkley\n\n\n"

Arrangements had already\nbeen made with the sponsor (the Board of County Commissioners of\nCuyahoga County) and the district W.P.A. officials for this step.\nSubscriptions were taken on the basis of a letter drafted by the\nJoint Committee and approved by the district W.P.A. and the sponsor,\noffering twenty-five volumes of the digest for $25.00 and promising\na pro-rata rebate if fewer volumes were delivered.\n\nThe minutes of the Joint Committee meeting show that it\nwas originally suggested that the libraries be asked to become co~\nsponsors of the project, in that way finding a means of contributing\nto it and sharing in its product. Discussion, however, indicated\nthat such a measure would be impractical because of legal restric~\ntions on library budgets. The alternative of taking subscriptions\nfor sets of the digest was therefore adopted.\n\nOn July 20, 1937, the regional office of W.P.A. at Chicago\nruled it to be contrary to W.P.A. policy to permit the sale of the\nproduct of W.P.A. labor, even though the proceeds of the sale were\nto return to the project in the form of additional materials. In\nthe supplemental project which was submitted to clear this problem,\nthe regional office approved the multigraphing of fifty copies for\nfree distribution to public and semi-public agencies, and fifty copies\nfor exchange purposes.\n\nWe are now circulating a financial statement covering the\nfunds handled by the Joint Committee in connection with this experi~\nmentel enterprise, together with a letter to the Director of Women's\nand Professionel Division of W.P.A. in Columbus, Ohio, concerning the\nhandling of the money remaining in the subscription fund.\n\n\n        \n          \n          \n        \n      \n\n\n        Expenditures\n      \n\n\n"

The possible function\nof union catalogues in the national library system is being altered not\nonly by the development of micro-copying in lieu of lending of books,\nperiodical articles, etc. controlled in a union catalogue, but by pos~\nsible inexpensive micro-copying of the union catalogues themselves.\nEstimates of prices at which micro-copies of union catalogues could be\ndistributed go as low as $50.00 per one million entries. The possibil~\nity appears, moreover, that the full subject catalogues of certain great\nlibraries may be placed on film and become available as a bibliographical\nand library tool to other libraries.\n\n\nIn the strategic development of the union catalogue, an issue is\narising between (1) concentration of all energy on completion of the\nnational union catalogue as a catalogue of rare books, and (2) development\nof regional catalogues to increase the efficiency in the expenditure of\nacquisition funds regionally, and to constitute the base from which the\nnational union catalogue will be completed. A project to copy the depos~\nitory catalogue of the Library of Congress on film and possibly to follow\nit with the national union catalogue on film will affect the ways of main~\ntaining a current flow of cards into the national wnion catalogue. Checks\nthat have been made between the Philadelphia and Cleveland union catalogues\nand the national union catalogue have provided figures on the percentage\nof overlapping duplication and unique holdings of our libraries. Dr.\nKletsch had compiled a list of special collections through the country\nwhich he had thought suitable for incorporation in the union catalogue.\n\nWhen this situation is examined as a whole, one feature stands out\nvery clearly in it, and that is that it is now possible to make quantita~\ntive estimates of the amount of union cataloguing that could be done, and\nthe cost of doing it, with an accuracy that would not have been possible a\nshort time ago. We can estimate far more accurately then has ever before\nbeen estimated the number of items that would be incorporated in a complete\nnational catalogue, the probable yield of new items that would result from\nvarious types of union cataloguing activity, and the balance of cost and\nutility that would be involved in following different plans.\n\nIn view of this situation should we not place on the agenda for the\nnext meeting of the Joint Committee the question of whether a well-defined\n\n        quantitative study of the union catalogue problem in the country should be\nundertaken?

A newspaper index must give enough information about each\nitem indexed to permit the consultant to decide whether or not he wants to\ngo to the file. The information given must be an absolute minimum for\npurpose.\n\n2. Since the consultant is assumed to use the file whenever\nhe uses the index, provisions for immediate or ultimate micro-copying of\nthe file should be a part of the plan.\n\n3. The procedure used in making the New York Times Index cannot\nbe followed in W.P.A. Their procedure involves the use of several copies\nof the newspaper, which are marked for indexing and are distributed among\nspecialists who are highly skilled in making index entries for different\nclasses of news. In W.P.A. we have only one file; we cannot mark it;\nwe must obtain accuracy without turning over the pages too often, as we\ncannot run through it again and again with successive specialists. Our\nprocedure must therefore be adapted to circumstances.\n\n4. The first decision to be made in an index is what classes of\nitems are to be indexed and what ones are to be excluded. Analysis of\nthe Cleveland newspapers has indicated that with fair consistency over 60%\nof a newspaper is advertising: about 8% is state news; about 3% foreign\nnews; and a little over 10% is local news. These proportions, constant\nfor the later nineteenth century, may shift somewhat in the more recent\nperiod.\n\nThe New York Times Index devotes half its space to marriage and\ndeath notices. This is a much larger proportion of the Index than these\nnotices occupy in the newspaper itself, but the Times finds that a great\nmany of their inquiries turn on this information. One major policy deci~\nsion that must be made is whether to attempt to carry under the general\nclassification of \"Death\" all death notices, and under \"Marriage\" all\nmarriage notices, classifying them under both the name of bride and groom.\n\nA sweeping decision might well eliminate all advertising, unless\nan exception is made for some particuler class of advertising, or the\nadvertising is indexed by name of advertiser for, say, two days a year,-\nJanuary 1 and July 1. Thie procedure might be advisable for any year in\nwhich there is no directory of business firms available.\n\n5. National news as news ought not to be covered. The feature\u00a0\ncolumns, as they become important in the more recent period, will give\n      \nrise to difficult decisions. Syndicated\u00a0feature columns perhaps should\n      \nbe treated differently, from feature columns written for the locality only.\u00a0\n\nAll local news and all editorials,\u00a0on whatever subject, should\n      \ncertainly be taken. The editorials can be identified with the symbol .\u00a0\nThere ie a strong argument for including out-of-town local news, especially\u00a0\nthat which comes from the state or from the West.\n\nAnother big problem is lists of names. The indexers have no\nway of distinguishing in an isolated case between an important name and an\nunimportant name, but neither can they list and alphabetize the names of\nall the members of all the committees that participated in organizing the\nElks' picnic. Some arbitrary rule will be necessary. Possibly something\nlike this will work: take no more than five names per column of story,\nand on short stories no more than one name per inch of column. We made\nan experiment in Cleveland in taking every proper name mentioned and found\nthe result was overwhelming, The main thing is that enforcible rules\nmust be laid down as to what is to be indexed and what is not to be indexed.\n\n6. When it has been decided what parts of the file are to be\nindexed, accuracy and uniformity of treatment must be guaranteed. How is\nthis to be done? The work might be organized in two steps: (a) The work~\ner who has the newspaper before him must write on a slip of paper for every\nstory the who, where, what of the atory, very briefly and including all\nindexable proper names. The procedure for this was well worked out in the\nCleveland Newspaper Digest project and could be followed here, except\nthat the Cleveland project included a procedure for taking quotations which\nwould not be followed here in indexing. (b) The reference line must be\nchecked by someone who takes the slips produced by a worker in one day\nand checks them for consistency, accuracy and fullness. The accuracy of\nthe worker's abstract must be checked by a sampling process. The worker's\nabstract and reference line should occupy the lower two-thirds of the slip;\nthe upper one-third should be left free for the indexer.\n\nThese slips, as they are completed by the person working with\nthe newspaper file and checked for accuracy, should pass into the hands\nof on indexing department, where the index must be normalized. At this\nsecond stage, the indexer, working with the slips of paper, must do three\nthings: (a) decide upon a subject classification; (b) write the brief\nentry which will actually appear in the index, writing it in the style of\nthe Times Index; (c) underline in colored pencil the proper names that are\nto be carricd in the index. It is at this stage that the index is made or\nlost; it is here that the standard of uniformity and consistency in the\ntreatment of topical heads must be enforced.\n\nNeedless to say, an approved list of subject heads must de used.\nOld volumes of the Times Index can provide some of these, and the results\nof the work of the Cleveland Newspaper Digest can be made available. No\nsubject entry can be invented on the spur of the moment by someone who\ndoes not have the responsibility for relating that subject entry to all\nother subject entries.\n\n7. The next stage is a clerical one that requires accuracy but\n\n        less knowledge. The slip, \n        \n      \n\n        the indexer, has become a\u00a0\n        parate slips must be made\nfor each proper name entry that has been approved by the indexer, for the\u00a0\nfinal product will alphabetize in one alphabet proper names and subject\nentries.\n\n8. When the clerks have made the additional slips, each of which\nmust carry not only the proper names but the reference line and the short\ndescription entry, the alphabetical filing must take place. The proper\nname cards should all be filed first, while the subject cards are gathered\nin a separate alphabet. Then a final review of the subject cards thus\nfiled alphabetically should be made, in the course of which general cross\nreferences will be filled in, as \"Transportation, see also Railroads,\"\nor \"Petroleum, see Oil,\" \"Verses, see Poetry,\" etc. Someone who understands\ncross reference work must organize this part of the index.\n\n9. When the subject index with its cross reference slips and the\nproper name slips stands in two complete alphabets, it can be interfiled\nand the index is ready for typing.\n\n10. The last stage is the typing and proofreading. If the pro~\nject permits it, it is probably desirable to mimeograph or otherwise mul~\ntiply the index. But if this cannot be provided for, at least a first\ncopy and two good carbons should be made, with a strong black ribbon, con~\nstantly fresh, being used on the first copy. The first copy can then be\nmicro-copied, so that anyone obtaining a copy of the original newspaper\nfile on film can also obtain a copy of the index on film. The three paper\ncopies can be bound.\n\nUnless the index is finally carried to typescript pages, it\nwill be difficult to control the quality and accuracy of the work. Faults\nwill show up very quickly on pages which would bury themselves if the index\nwere left on cards.\n\n\n11. In training the personnel that is to make the entries from\nthe workers' abstracts, some extra copies of the Cleveland Newspaper Di~\ngest could be used. This would give the workers an idea of condensation\nand the system of subject entries. They would have to reduce every item\nto the four-to-six words that constitute a Times Index entry.\n\n\n"

    "text": "\n\nFebruary 5, 1938\n\nMEMORANDUM ON NEWSPAPER POLICY\n\nNewspapers constitute a category of material widely utilized\nin research. Three characteristics call for the attention of this com~\nmittee: (1) The high perishability of the files themselves, which can be\ncontrolled by micro-copying; (2) the distribution of the files among de~\npositories, which renders travel more necessary in the use of this mater~\nby scholars than in the use of book or periodical material. To the\nextent that micro-copying is combined with adequate long-term lending\nconditions 1 and 2 are rectified. (3) The heterogeneous character of the\ncontents, which can be controlled by calendaring, digesting, or indexing\noperations.\n\nA study of preservation (1) and of accessibility (2) is now in\norder. Ideally, we can Say that if all newspaper files were micro-copied\nand an extra positive of all files were available for lending purposes,\nthe problem of preservation and accessibility would be met; technically,\nwe know that newspaper files of the woodpulp period which are not micro-\ncopied will sooner or later be wholly lost; practically, we know that the\nnation as a whole has an interest in preventing this ultimate destruction,\nbut the resources that can be freely directed to the protection of the\nnational interest in this matter are not sufficient to swing the whole job.\nThe heterogeneous character of the content of newspaper files calls for\na vast amount of clerical or semi-skilled scholarly labor, the supply of\nwhich will come in all probability only from white collar relief rolls\non the one hand or volunteer amateur efforts on the other. The Joint Com~\nmittee has taken measures to prepare the way for meeting this situation.\n\nThe first question to be faced by this Committee is whether the\nCommittee should address itself to this problem or let the matter drift.\nIf we take up the problem, a variety of approaches is possible.\n\nThe Committee could proceed on the assumption that there is a\nnational interest in preserving a certain proportion of the newspaper files.\nIt could then set on foot an inquiry to determine how many files and which\nspecific files would meet the clearest national interest. It could esti~\nmate the cost of this work of preservation, and leave it to foundations\nwhose funds are administered for the support of national cultural interests\nto decide whether the result is worth the investment.\n\nA second possibility is somewhat differently conceived. We\nmight proceed on the assumption that the interest in the preservation of\nnewspaper files is partly national and partly local to the area in which\nthe newspaper wan published, and that within that area it might be pre~\nsumed that local cultural institutions and newspaper publishers themselves\nshare in a local interest. Upon this principle it is possible that a\ngeneral formula could be devised involving a national and a local contri~\nbution, and the fomula and division of responsibility could be so estab~\nlished that there would be in effect a continuous fertilizing by local\ncontributions of an original national foundation grant. The first alterna~\ntive sets before us the picture of a job to be accomplished and completed;\nthe second, of a process to be organized.\n\nIn some neighborhoods there is a lawn roller which is passed\nfrom one householder to another every spring. The householder who borrows\nthe roller must contribute his own labor, and the community gets the\nbenefit of the improved appearance of the street. Perhaps something\nsimilar is possible in newspaper preservation. Let the best of apparatus\nbe made accessible free of charge to a community that will do its share\nin using it.\n\nPerhaps this isn't enough. Local funds may not respond to this\nopportunity. What additional inducement can be envisaged? Possibly in\nthose cases where no complete file of the newspsper is found in the lo~\ncality of its publication, aid could be freely given for filling in from\nfiles existing elsewhere; possibly the contribution of the locality should\nbe set in terms of film footage or of the labor of bringing a newspaper\nfile into shape for filming. The locality might provide the film and cler~\nical labor; the foundation, the machine and the processing.\n\nWhether the fundamental decision is in favor of the first or\nsecond plan, or some alternative plan, a policy in the matter of deposit\nof negative, lending of positive, making and selling of positives from\nnegatives must be worked out. If this part of the establishment can be\nmade to yield a revenue, the revenue can be re-invested in additional film\noperations under either plan. Perhaps the revenue feature of this part\nof the filming system could be organized in a manner comparable to the ad~\nministration of the Photostat collection of the Modern Language Association.\nLibraries, by annual subscription, would obtain borrowing rights in a\nconstantly increasing volume of film positives. These borrowing rights\nwould increase in value to the subscribing libraries with every increase\nin the variety of the files available in micro~copy form. Ultimately the\nsituation might reach an equilibrium as libraries determined what propor~\ntions of their accession budgets was properly devotable to newspapers, and\nwhat proportion of the sum thus to be utilized was best expendable for\nrights in a mounting collection of micro-copies.\n\nThe foregoing discussion relates to the preservation of news~\npaper files and to the improvement of their accessibility. But, as has\nbeen noted above, there is another feature of newspaper category of mater~\nial which calls for special action, and that is its heterogeneous character,\nwhich yields to such controls as are provided by calendaring, digesting\nand indexing.\n\nThe present status of the relief program is such that in many\nlocalities a special stimulus may perhaps be given toward the provision\nof funds for micro-copying under the second assumption, because such\nefforts can be associated with indexing work within the relief program.\nThis situation does not modify the fundamental feature of that balance\nbetween local and national interest in the preservation of newspaper\nfiles; it mearly makes possible at the present juncture a more active local\ninterest than would otherwise be easily predictable. By the time this\nsituation has run its course, the force of example will be much greater\nas a stimulus to activity in localities which have taken no preservative\nmeasures in respect of their newspapers.\n\nHow can a decision be best reached between alternatives One and\nTwo -- a national project, and a system of helping local initiative -- and any\nother method of organizing preservation and accessibility? What is the\nmost desirable arrangement for the administration of the proposed service, --\nAmerican Documentation Institute, University of Chicago, both, or other\nagencies? What is the ideal role of the Library of Congress?\n\n\n"

If the right techniques of standards and procedures are est~\nablished, the supply of this labor can come from the works program.\n\n(3) The practice of inter-library lending of film coples of news~\nPapers will be in the interest of the libraries, since it will enable\nany of them to make available to its own readers any newspaper file\neven from another locality. The objects for which newspapers are con~\nsulted are such that no library can afford to acquire, either in film\nor on paper, all the files which its clientele might seek to consult.\nThe establishment of this practice should be the contribution of the\nlibrary.\n\nAn adequate newspaper program therefore calls for the coordina~\ntion of the local interest, the national scholarly interest, the in~\nterest of the relief program, and the library interest in promoting\nnational cultural welfare.\n\nAt the last annual meeting of the Joint Committee on Materials\nfor Research, held in January, 1938, the outlines of a concrete pro~\nposal were sketched as follows.\n\n(1) An effort to promote the micro-copying of newspaper files\nshould be undertaken by a non-profit agency, probably the American\nDocumentation Institute, operating with money to be obtained from one\nof the Foundations. The ADI should offer to any community the loan\nof photographic equipment for copying its local newspaper files, and\nshould make available film processing services at cost. In cases\nwhere the locality did not possess a complete file of its own news~\npapers but where the gaps in the file could be filled by micro-copying\nfiles available elsewhere, the ADI should render this service. The\nservice should be made available to the commmity on condition that\nsome agency within the commnity should contribute the film and labor\nfor collating and photographing the file.\n\n(2) This micro-copying enterprise should normally be undertaken\nin communities which, as a part of their share in the work relief\nprogram, find sponsorship for an appropriately-planned indexing project,\nthe procedure and standards for which would be worked out by studying\nthe experience of newspaper indexing activities both within the relief\nprogram and outside it.\n\n(3) An arrangement should be made by which, through the lending of\nmicro-copies of newspapers, the micro-copied file together with the\nindex would be made available anywhere in the nation, and thus added\nnot only to the local but also to the national cultural resources.\n\nIn order to give this general program the form of a concrete de~\ntailed project, plans must be made in two areas: first, in regard to\nequipment, administration and operation of micro-copying itself, to~\ngether with estimates of costs, to the end that a budget could be pre~\npared for presentation to a Foundation and that cost estimates might\nbe presented to local interests; second, in respect to detailed and\nadequate working procedures for the indexing of newspaper files, to~\ngether with enforcible standards of quality in the work and practical\nestimates of costs of the work, all within the framework of the relief\nprogram.\n\n\nII. Technical Problems involved in Micro-copying Newspaper Files\n      \n\nThe Bureau of Standards has shown that cellulose acetate safety\nfilm, properly processed, is permanent. The Eastman Company, in\nmicro-copying current numbers of fifty newspapers, has shown that 18-\ndiameter reduction of newspapers to 35mm. film is practical. The\nEastman Company has equipment for copying bound files. Other types of\nequipment are available also.\n\nArrangements for photographing must guarantee accurate work in\nrespect of fineness of focus and uniformity of density resulting from\nexposure. Arrangements for processing must guarantee adequate fixing\nand washing, and the product of the micro-copying enterprise must be\na strip of negative film from which positives can be made by continu~\nous process equipment.\n\nThe tentative budget to be presented to a Foundation should fill\nin the following figures:\n\n(1) Cost of camera equipment, with subdsidiary testing apparatus,\nfor use in the localities in photographing the files; cost of shipping\nthis equipment from point to point.\n\n(2) Cost of setting up adequate centralized processing plant in\nthe American Documentation Institute.\n\n(3) Overhead costs\n\n\n(4) Costs of copying to fill gaps in file. (Responsibility as~\nsumed by the ADI in procuring film copies of missing numbers of news~\npapers should not be unlimited. The appropriate limitation might be\na percentage of the total number of pages, the copying of which is\nfinanced, or a limitation to such newspapers as happen to be available\nin Washington, D.C.)\n\n\n\n\nThe tentative budget to be presented to a community should fill\nin the following figures:\n\n(1) Cost of film and materials per 1000 pages of newspaper\n\n(2) Labor cost of photographing 1000 pages of newspaper with\nequipment described above\n\n(3) Cost of collating files depends so much upon local circum~\nstances that it cannot be estimated by any uniform rule, though cer~\ntain principles for its estimation might be laid down.\n\nWhen these figures are filled in, concrete proposals can be pre~sented to the Foundations and to the communities.\n\n\nIII. Compilation of Index, Guide, Calendar, Digest, or other type of\n      \n\n        Control to the Contents of the Newspaper File\n      \n\nWe know from experience that relief labor can render newspaper\nfiles more useful to the public. We do not know what specific use of\nrelief labor will give us maximum yield in value for lowest cost.\nWe can discover this relationship only by a careful examination of the\nvalues and uses of newspaper guides, indexes, and digests, and of the\ncosts incurred in their compilation. Value depends on the number and\ncharacter of the uses to which the index or guide is put, and the\nnumber of people to whom it is accessible. Accessibility can be en~\nvisaged at three levels: (1) the existence of a unique card file;\n(2) a micro-copied index along with the micro-copied file itself;\n(3) an index multiplied in book form to be used independently of the\nmicro-copied newspaper in some cases, and to be supported by consult~\ning the micro-copied newspaper in other cases.\n\nA. Determining the Right Principles of Indexing.\n\nThe character of the indexing operation that will yield the high~\nest utility per unit of cost will not be the same under these three\nconditions of availability. What are the alternative characteristics\nof newspaper indexing, and how are they related to the conditions of\navailability of copies of the newspapers on the one hand, and of the\nindex on the other?\n\nThe appropriate features of a newspaper index for each of these\nsituations cannot be determined without careful investigation of values\nand costs. Such an investigation might be made by carrying out simul~\ntaneously the following steps:\n\n(1) Study samples of the product of a number of newspaper index~\ning projects that have been operated by WPA. The study should bring\nout a comparison of\n\na) The rules made for the selection of items in tho news~\npapers for indexing, and their application\n\nb) The rules made for the classifying of the index, and their\napplication\n\nc) The number of index entries made and the number of news~\npaper pages covered\n\nd) The experience of the project in relation to training,\nexperimental wastes, supervisioni, classification of workers, etc.\n\ne) The utility of the index as completed, if the project\nhas reached that point\n\nf) A sample run of a few pages of the index, made from\neach of hte different types, might be mimeographed for comparison and\nstudy.\n\n\n(2) If there are types of indexing not represented by this ex~\nperience, short experiments covering a few days or weeks of nowspaper\nfiles should be made to illustrate alternative possibilities.\n\n(3) Study values and utilities of existing indexes from the stand~\npoint of those whose experience with indexed and unindexed newspapers\nqualifies them to judge as experts, notably\n\na) Library reference\nb) Historical research\nc) Legal use by attorneys\nd) Genealogical use\ne) Journalistic use\nf) Governmental use\ng) Business use\n\nA group of individuals able and willing to give expert opinion\nshould be found; they should be induced to devote the requisite thought\nand study to the material collected and organized under (1) and (2)\nabove. They should then be called to a conference to advise with WPA\non the writing of standard procedures.\n\nSome of the alternative principles of indexing and a statement\nof considerations bearing upon their relative values are annexed\nhereto as a supplementary memorandum.\n\nB. Determining tha Right Principles of Administration, and the Place\n      \n\n        of thie kind of Project in the Works Program.\n\nNewspaper indexing is a task almost unlimited quantitatively.\nEvery year of every newspaper indexed is nonetheless a valuable unit\nin itself. The value increases as the number of years covered brings\nthe whole newspaper record under control. But it is probably wise to\nthink of this work as a long-term job, a continuing responsibility of\nany works program, wiich will in a sense build up library resources,\neven as certain other types of project, notably in the adult education\nfield, intensify the use of existing library resources.\n\nIt might be advisable, therefore, from the standpoint of the\nworks program, to think of newspaper indexing in terms of projects of\nmoderate size, subject to indefinite continuation and to possible ex~\npansion when the need for additional relief projects appears, and to\ncontraction when the relief load is light, but to be maintained con~\nstantly in operation when they are meeting the standards of performance\nand cost percent of work.\n\nIt would be advantageous to devise a working procedure calling\nfor most of the labor in the clerical rather than the professional\nclascifications. Since the skill in this work develops with experi~\nence, it may be especially suitable for the older type of employable\nclerical worker, whose prospect of getting into private industry is low.\n\n\n        This feature of a newspaper indexing project in WPA policy may\nrun into difficulties in connection with the object outlined a Sec~\ntion II, -- the micro-copying of whole newspaper flles, -- for the cost\nincurred in micro-copying the whole file is large in comparison with\n      \nthe cost of indexing a part of it.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps the situation could be met by permitting sponsors to have\nprojects\u00a0 approved if they agree to micro-copy their files as fast as\nthe WPA indexes them. In this case the community might not have re~\ncourse to the loaned equipment. The decision of this question must\nawait the compilation of specific cost figures and estimates for all\noperations, both of indexing and micro-copying, in units of thousands\nof pages of newspaper files.\n\nC. Units for Cost Estimates\n      \n\nThe introduction of woodpulp paper in the period from 1860-1880\nled to a great increase in the bulk of newspapers. The ratio of ad-\nvertising to news seems to have stood fairly constant throughout.\nBecause the bulk of newspaper material is in the period since 1900,\nthe total number of pages and of column inches in any newspaper file\nin any city is of the same order of magnitude with the mumber of pages\nin another city of the same size.\n\nA unit can be taken as a four-page paper, appearing every day\nfor a year, making 1460 pages, 250,000 column inches, reducible to\n180 feet of 35mm. film. A fourteen-year file of a four-page weekly\npaper of half-size would equal one such unit.\n\nCleveland figures for one file of a newspaper from 1819 to 1935\nare probably normal for a city of this size.\n\nYears | Period | Units\n17 | 1819 - 1835 | 2\n14 | 1836 - 1849 | 12\n10 | 1850 - 1859 | 10\n10 | 1860 - 1869 | 11\u00a0\n10 | 1870 - 1879 | 13\n10 | 1880 - 1889 | 14\n10 | 1890 - 1699 | 21\n10 | 1900 - 1909 | 21\n10 | 1920 - 1919 | 41\n10 | 1920 - 1929 | 116\n5 | 1930 - 1935 | 58\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n| | 319\n\n\n        Annex: Considerations bearing upon Principles to be Applied in\n      \n\n        Newspaper Indexing\n      \n\nA. Completeness of Entry.\n\nAn index may be so compiled that it renders consultation of\nthe original newspaper unnecessary for some purposes. In some cases\nthe newspaper index will take the research directly to a public\nrecord, by-passing the file. The number of uses for which the in~\ndex is a substitute for the original file depends upon the complete~\nness of indexing entries. An index that is to be multiplied in book\nform, and hence be available where micro-copies of the newspaper are\nnot immediately at hand, should have greater completeness of entries\nthan an index that is to be available only in coincidence with the\noriginal newspaper.\n\nAn extreme of competeness is the Bulletin Periodique de la\n      \n\n        Press \u00c9trang\u00e8re, issued by the French Ministry of War during the\nWorld War, and the Daily Review of the Foreign Press,\u00a0issued by the\nGovernment in the same period. These treat a limited range\nof subjects (political) so completely that reference to the original\nfiles is unnecessary. Of less completeness of entry, and greater\ncomprehensiveness, is the Cleveland Newspaper Digest, a W.P.A. pro~\nduct. Still less complete in entries, and still more comprehensive\nin the classes of entries covered, is the New York Times Index. The\nminimum completeness of entry is an index to proper names, as of\npersons, societies, government units, buildings, places.\n\n B. The Local Reference Principle applied to include Out-of-Town\n      \n\n        News from the \"West.\"\n      \n\nThe newspaper file, without any index, will answer the refer~\nence question, \"What did the newspapers of St. Paul record as having\nhappened in St. Paul on such and such a date?\" They will not answer\nthe question, \u201cWhat did the newspapers of New York record as having\nhappened in St. Paul?\" In the earlier period of our history much\nnews of local events in Western states was published only in the\nEastern newspapers. Some Western historical societies have under~\ntaken to search certain newspaper files for these \"Western letters.\"\n\nIt would therefore be useful to have indexes of Eastern news~\npapers prior to some date, such as 1880, note items originating in\nWestern localities, and classify then by place and date. Perhaps\nthese index notes could then be cleared through to the locality\ninterested, though that is a separate question.\n\nC. The Principle of the Exclusion of National and Foreign News\n      \n\nIt can be assumed that all newspapers will duplicate each other\nin their accounts of events that are national in charactor as being\n\nacts of the National Government, speeches in Congress, etc.; that\nthe same will be true of foreign news; and that American newspapers\ndo not constitute the best source of information about events taking\nplace abroad. In general, for this reason, it might be considered\ninadvisable to include in an index newspaper items of national\nnews and of foreign news. (National news takes about 13%, foreign\nnews about 3%, state news 8% of newspaper space.)\n\nOn the other hand, the proposal has been made that a serious\neffort should be made to collect from the newspapers items relating\nto Lincoln. If these items were found as a part of state news in\nIllinois papers, they would also collect themselves in  a proper names\nindex; they would also collect themselves indirectly in the Eastern\npapers under the rule that events in the West would be indexed by\nlocality of origin.\n\nD. Proper Names and Subject Index\n      \n\nA proper names index requires far less professional skill for\nits compilation than a subject index. One half of the New York\n\n        Times Index is made up of proper names entries on marriages andd\ndeaths.\n\nSome subjects can be traced through proper names as soon as a\nclue is found. For instance, most of the items on music, theatre,\nand entertainment revealed in the Cleveland Newspaper Digest under\nthese heads would be traceable through the proper names of Melodeon\nHall, Public Library, etc. A story can be followed conveniently\nthrough a period of time through the names of the persons involved.\n\nSubject classifications are so much a matter of choice that\ntheir value diminishes to the degree that the index, by skeleton-\nizing the entry, makes it difficult for the user of the index to\nbe sure that his interpretation of the subject agrees with that of\nthe Indexer. It is possible, however, to select certain specific\nsubjects which for some special reason are of moment, and to bring\nout all items relating to these subjects. The smaller this list,\nand the more definite the subject headings in their relation to the\nactual form of the newspaper stories, the more successful will be\nthe work.\n\nA newspaper index which is to be multiplied in book form, and\nhence develop each item with relative completeness, can be more\naccurately and usefully given subject classification than an index\nthat is to be micro-copied and used only with the copy of the news~\npaper itself.\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "\n\nTechniques and Policies\nof\nDocumentary Reproduction\n\n\n        June 24, 1938\n      \n\nNot since the invention of printing have the arts\nof communication been subjected to so stupendous a techno~\nlogical impact as that which comes upon them today. On the\none hand, radio reaches the masses without the usa of writ~\ning: on the other hand, new techniques in the graphic arts\ngive to written texts a special accessibility they have never\nbefore possessed. Whether the radio will operate to preserve\nor \n        destroy the bonds of thought that unite the world's intel~\niectual commonwealth is a choice that lies beyond our juris~\ndiction; but the effect of the new techniques in the graphic\narts upon this world commonwealth will be determined by the\npolicies adopted ty the agencies of scholarship, librarian~\nship, and archival science that are represented in this very\nCongress.\n\nThe use of writing in the world of thought is nor~\nmalized in four procedures: correspondence, publication,\ncircularization, and deposit. Correspondence is usually by\n letter, -- a unique document going from a writer to a reader.\nPublication is normalliy on the scale of 2000 or more copies\nof an identical text, distributed by sale to readers direct~\nly, or serviced to them indirectly through libraries. Inter~\nmediate between correspondence and publication is the pro~\ncedure of circularization, often in a few score of copies,\nin mimeograph form. This procedure is often used for\ncommittee reports and other internal documents of scholarship.\nDeposit ordinarily involves fhe accumulation of one copy each\nof many texts, printed or manuscript, collected or archival\nin a place where they can be consulted.\n\nThe essence of all these procedures is communication\nfrom writer to reader, whether the communication be immediate\nor deferred, to one reader or to many, to known persons or to\npersons unknown, and whether the men of the past communicate\nwith the men of the present or the men of the present commun~\nicate with the men of the future. Post office, publisher,\nbookseller, librarian, and archivist are all administrators\nof the communication of writings.\n\nThere are indeed some property tenures vested at\ndifferent points along these channels of communication. They\nare like the tolls along the river, some of them necessary\nto keep the channel open, some of them functionally piratical.\nBut in general it can be said that thoughts are still of all\nthings in the world the most nearly free, that most of the\nwritten texts upon which thought is recorded are freely dis~\nclosed to those who would examine them, and that people who\nhold ideas worthy of expression feel rather an urge to ex~\npress them and share them than to withhold them from the world.\n\nThe costs and uses of the different processes for\nthe communication of texts vary among themselves, but taken\ntogether they should form a system. In this system we might\nsay that printing and publication as we have known it can be\nlikened to expensive concrete highway construction for roads\nthat are heavily travelled; mimeograph and planograph are\nlike the less expensive surfaces for roads that are more\nlightly travelled; and blueprint and micro-copying are the\ndirt roads, the footpaths, and the trails that reach everywhere.\n\nThe great contribution of printing to the function~\ning of the system of communication was its ability to convey\nthe same text to many readers, situated at many different\nplaces, at costs much below those incurred in the copying of\nmanuscripts. This is still the function of printing and pub~\nlication; their place among the channels of communication is\nnot challenged where this situation obtains. The technology\nand accountancy of printing and publication define with great\naccuracy the situations to which they are applicable, -- namely,\nthose in which 2000 book purchasers are willing to share\namong themselves the costs of making and distributing a book.\n\nThe contribution of the so-called near-print pro~\ncesses -- hectograph, mimeograph, planograph -- to the system of\ncommunication lies in their ability to distribute texts when\nthe recipients are numbered in scores or a few hundreds only.\nFor instance, there is now being compiled in the United States\na comprehensive inventory of local archives and church records.\nThe inventories when completed will fill many hundreds of\nthousands of pages. In every community there is need of an\ninventory of the archives of that community, but the needs of\nnational scholarship are met by having a complete set of this\ninventory in about 100 depositories strategically located\nthroughout the country. It would be a misuse of the printing\ntechnique to incur the cost of printing these inventories\nwhen the number of copies required falls in this range, there~\nfore they are being mimeographed.\n\nConcerning every text that is put into the channel\nof communication, the question properly arises: Where is it\nto go; how many ought to receive it? However this question\nbe answered, that is to say, whether the transmission of 20\nor of 20,000 copies will fulfill the purposes of communication,\nthere is a technique of reproduction appropriate to the cir~\ncumstance.\n\nIf the channel of communication is to be kept open\nby levying upon the recipients of texts their pro-rata share\nof the cost of the whole edition, there are two ways of doing\nthis. The first of these has generslly been followed in the\npast, namely, to print the text and fix a price at which the\nnumber of book purchasers actually entering the market will\npay the whole cost of production. But experience in the pub~\nlishing industry shows that book purchasers will not ordinarily\nassume their pro-rata share of the publication if there are\nless than 1000 or 2000 buyers. The second method is to esti~\nmate the number of potential purchasers and the price they\nwould be willing to pay, and then multiply the the text by a\ntechnique and in an edition that would fit the estimate.\n\nFor each technique, whether printing or near-printing,\nand for each variant of format, there is an edition size at\nwhich production costs per copy touch the level at which book\nbuyers will enter the market. Estimates based on American\ncosts yield the following results: At a production cost per\ncopy of $1.50 per 100,000 words, printed books must be issued\nin an edition of 550 copies; planographed books in editions\nof 250; mimeographed ones, 115 copies; and hectographed ones,\n90 copies. If a text for which there is to be circulation\nof 115 copies only is printed, the production cost of each\ncopy will be not $1.50, but more nearly $7.50. At such pro~\nduction costs, recipients will not pay their share, and cir~\nculation dries up.\n\nThese estimates cover manufacturing costs only. In\nthe publishing industry, costs of distribution are incurred\nin order to bring about the sharing of the cost of production.\nIn some cases a communication will actually be cheaper and\nmore effective if no attempt is made to recoup production costs\nfrom recipients. Letters and circulars are ordinarily com~\nmunicated in this way. In fact, is it not our experience\nthat when we wish to get action upon a document, we usually\ncommunicate the document directly to the person whose action\nis desired without asking him to share the cost of making the\ncopy? This principle cannot and should not be extended to all\ncommunications, but it is quite possible that many texts now\n\npublished and sold as monographs would more effectively fulfill\ntheir purposes and at less cost to their producer if they were\nsimply mimeographed, circulated to the known specialists in the\nfield, and deposited for reference in certain libraries.\n\nIn all of these processes -- printing and near-printing --\nthere is always a first cost (setting the type, preparing the\nplanograph plate, making the mimeograph stencil) which must be\nincurred regardless of the number of copies that are made; and\n running cost (for ink, paper, binding, and labor) which is\nproportionate to the size of the edition. Up to a certain\npoint in edition size, more than half of the production cost\nof each copy is found in the item of first cost; after that\npoint in edition size is passed, running costs exceed the first\ncost. The point in edition size at which first costs exactly\nequal running costs is specific for every process. In print~\ning, at American price levels, it is in approximately an\nedition of 2000 copies; in planograph, 1000; in mimeograph, 400;\nand in hectograph, 77.\n\nConsider, for instance, a book that can be set up\nin press, ready to run, for $500 (first cost). An additional\ncost of $125 will be incurred for paper, ink, and labor in\nrunning an edition of 500 copies. The production cost per\ncopy in this edition of 50O is therefore $2.25. If the edition\nsize is raised to 1000 copies, another $125 of running cost\nwill be incurred, but the total production cost per copy will\nfall to $.75. In an edition of 2000, $500 of running cost\nwill have been incurred (exactly matching the $500 of first\ncost), and the cost per copy of the product will have fallen\nto $.50. If the edition is increased beyond this efficiency\npoint, production costs per copy will continue to fall, but\nmore slowly. In an edition of 3000, the cost per copy will\nbe \u00a7.42; in an edition of 4000, it would be $.37. Most of\nthe economies that can be effected by the printing technique\nare reached at the 2000 edition mark. In planograph work,\n1000 copies is the efficiency edition, and in mimeographing\nit is 400 copies. That is to say, if we had carefully-\nitemized statements from printers, planographers, or mimeo~\ngraphers, analyzing the costs incurred in producing 2000\ncopies of a printed book, 1000 of a planographed book, or\n400 copies of a mimeographed book, we ought to find that in\neach case half the cost was chargeable to operations and\nmaterials needed in running off the copies.\n\nWhether we attempt to recopy production costs of\ntexts by pro-rating them among recipients or by having the\nproducers of texts assume these costs themselves, there is a\n\ntechnological advantage in carrying an edition if possible to\nits efficiency point, and in choosing for any enterprise of\ntext distribution a process which will reach all desired re~\ncipients by operating at or near its efficiency point. It is\ntechnologically just as inappropriate to mimeograph as many\nas 2000 copies as it is to print only 400.\n\nThere is another series of processes based upon\nphotography that is revolutionary in character because it oper~\nates with efficiency points of one to five copies. These pro~\ncesses can be called non-edition processes because they permit\npractically the manufacture-to-order of copies of text as fast\nas demand for them appears. The processes are of two families --\nthe blueprint family and the micro-copying family. First let\nus consider the blueprint family.\n\nA properly prepared typescript text, properly mounted\nin sheets of appropriate size, can be run through a blueprint\nmachine (or one of the variants that yield a black-on-white\ncopy), and new copies struck off at costs running from $.03\nto $.06 per square foot. A 400-page octavo book, with 6 x 9\npages, presents 150 square feet of text. Such a text can be\nmultiplied in unique copies made to order by one or another of\nthe blueprint processes at costs from $4.50 to $9.00.  A book\nby Elizabeth M. Richards on Alexander Vattemare and His System\n      \n\n        of International Exchanges has has been issued experimentally in\nthis way. This method is available not only for the multi~\nplication of typescript made with black ribbon on thin paper,\nbut also for paper negatives photostated from any text. An\nauthor's typescript or an out-of-print book can both be brought\ninto circulation by this method.\n\nMicro-copying is, of all photographic techniques,\nthe most elastic in its applications. It imposes upon the\nreader the burden of precuring for himself the reading appara~\ntus, but it offers to readers thus equipped a practically\nunlimited range of utilities. Wherever there are installations\nof efficient micro-copying machines, unique copies of any text\ncan be made to order and on demand at costs per 1000 words that\nare in the price range of normal book costs, or below it.\nJust as in printing the lowest unit costs are reached when a\nlarge number of copies of the same text is made, so in micro~\ncopying the lowest unit costs are reached when a long run of\npages is copied uniformly and in sequence.\n\nThe different applications of the micro-copying\ntechnique vary among themselves as widely as does mimeographing\nfrom printing. The principal technical differences are those\n\nbetween the short run of a few pages and the long run of many\nthousand pages, and between the low reduction ratio of 10-12\ndiameters and the high reduction ratio of 18-20 diameters.\nThe Bibliofilm Service, operated by the American Documentation\nInstitute, furnishes a great many micro-copies of short scien~\ntific articles in reductions of 10-12 diameters. About forty\nAmerican newspapers are currently reproduced on film for stor~\nage and preservation in a reduction of 18 diameters. It has\nbecome to feasible to plan for the preservation on film of the\nbillions of pages of newspapers, periodicals, books, and manu~\nscripts that bear their texts on perishable paper. It is also\ntechnically possible for libraries and depositories to round\nout and complete their collections regardless of the accident\nof the market. More than this, it has become technically\npossible for any body of documentation to be made available\nanywhere in the world.\n\nLibraries are beginning  to plan cooperative projects\nin the field of microphotography. The financial terms upon\nwhich such cooperation is equitably to be effected have not\nas yet crystallised. In the early days of the railroad a vast\namount of experiment in rate structures preceded the stabili~\nzation of railway rate practices. In the beginning of micro-\ncopying services there must also be experiment, but some of\nthe principles governing such experiments may even now be sug~\ngested.\n\nThere is a sense now in which all texts now organized\nin depositories may be regarded as being technologically equiv~\nalent to \"books in print.\" There is a sense in which the func~\ntion of collecting materials can merge technologically with the\nfunction of \"publishing\" them, if by publishing we mean provid~\ning copies on demand. Collecting and \"publishing\" tend to merge\nalso in another way, for micro-copying can be a means of making\ncollections, bringing together copies of texts otherwise\nscattered among various depositories. We can, for instance,\nconceive of enterprises that will bring together, by means of\nfilm, documents scattered or inaccessible in China, or in\nLatin America.\n\nIn organizing and financing such projects there is a\nstrong case for interlibrary cooperation and sharing of ex~\npenses. The number of libraries whose cooperation is indicated\nfor any such enterprise can be deduced from the principles\ngoverning size of edition that apply to printing and near-print\ntechniques. For in micro-copying, the making of the negative\nis a true \"first cost,\" and the making of positives from the\nnegative is a true \"running cost.\"\n\nLet me illustrate: Suppose we were to plan an enter~\nprise in which an expedition were to be sent to China or Latin\nAmerica to collect on film ten million pages of text. A photo~\ngraphic expedition would have to be fitted out, and all the\ncosts of travel and operations would become part of the first\ncost of the film. Let us say that the ten million pages are\nreproduced on 200,000 feet off film.\u00a0The cost of film and pro~ \ncessing in making each positive is a running cost. The running\u00a0 \ncost per copy might be about $10,000. If the cost of the ex~\npedition were estimated at $100,000, the\u00a0number of cooperating \nlibraries should be ten, each of which would contribute a total\nof $20.000, half to\u00a0the cost of making the one negative, half \nto the cost of making the positive which the library would then\u00a0 \nown. The participation of more than ten libraries in such a\nproject would still reduce the cost to each of the finished\npositive film, but the savings would be less and less substan~\ntial as the number of participant subscribers increased beyond\nthe efficiency point. If another ten libraries wish to utilize\nthe method in expanding their resources, they would do\nbetter to organize another enterprise operating in another\nfield, and count on mutual loans to give the benefit of both\nprojects to all.\n\nAt another extreme in the potential library use of\nmicro-copying is the making of micro-copies of books or period~\nical articles in lieu of loans. How shall library practice in\nthis field be developed? Shall we make and hold a negative,\nand issue a positive to the individual user? That would mean\nsetting up and administering a secondary library of short film\nstrips, duplicating in a fragmentary way the library of books.\nThere is probably a minimum number of pages, a minimum footage\nof film, at which it will be economical to make and hold a\nnegative. This may be a unit of a hundred feet of film; it\nmay be less, it may be more. The administrative cost of organ~\nizing a collection of short runs of pages will exceed the oper~\nating cost of recopying for each user; for long runs of pages\nthis relation will be reversed.\n\nAt this point another element of library policy\nappears: the preservation of material from the results of wear\nor chemical disintegration. Any material that is being worn\nout, weather in filming operations or by desk use, must either\nbe withdrawn from use or filmed, so that film may be substituted\nfor paper. Perhaps the user of materials that are perishing\nmay be brought to contribute toward their preservation. Cer~\ntainly it will tax our utmost administrative capacity to derive\nfull benefit from these new techniques in library service without\ncharging ourselves with the expense of too much lost motion.\n\nThe individual scholar, no less than the library,\nhas placed upon him not only new opportunities but new respon~\nsibilities. In the past, scholars have conceived of the book\nas the only proper unit in which the results of their labors\ncan be communicated. Now they can plan to make available to\ntheir colleagues not only that portion of their product which\nis suitable for book production, but also the underlying\nmaterials and working papers. Just as the scholar will benefit\nby library policies keyed to the use of microphotography, so\nthe library will benefit from new activities of scholars. The\nscholar who goes out on his own and gathers his material in\nfilm copy form will find the library a willing depository of\nhis accumulation when he has finished his own use of it.\n\nThese techniques taken in their entirety are a chal~\nlenge to scholar, librarians, and archivists. They invite\nscholars to think of their work not so much as the making of\nbooks, but rather as the communicating of ideas. To librarians\nand archivists, they present the issue of whether libraries and\narchive depositories are to be operated primarily as store~\nhouses or property or power houses of cultural energy. All\nthe traditions of four centuries of scholarship converge upon\nthe book in print as a sacred symbol of thought. Much of the\ntradition of librarianship and archival practice is that of\nthe collector and preserver of valued goods. But scholars now\nhave many things to say to each other which they cannot say in\nbooks, because the technique and accountancy of printed book\npublication do not permit anything to be said unless it is said\nin the same words to 2000 people; and libraries, even the\ngreatest of them, are overwhelmed by the geometrical increase\nin the quantity of the world's documentation, so that none of\nthem can, as collectors, hold for their readers more than a\nsampling of the record of civilization. The libraries have\nthrough union cataloguing and lending policies worked out meth~\nods of pooling their resources. Micro-copying can now greatly\nmultiply their pooled efficiency. Certain sweeping changes in\npolicy would seem, however, to be necessary if micro-copying\nis to pull its full potential weight. Hitherto, libraries have\nloaned among themselves books and small items easily transported\nby mail; hereafter, it will probably be more efficient to meet\nsuch demands by micro-copying small items in lieu of lending.\n\nThere are also the larger units in which micro-copying\nworks at its highest efficiency, because it can be done at a\nhigh reduction ratio in long sequences of pages. I am think~\ning of such things as newspaper and periodical files, and of\nbook collections of various kinds. I am thinking of the\nstrategy of preservation calculated to meet not only the\n\ncertainties of chemical disintegration where texts are borne on\nperishable paper, but the risks of destruction in war, fire,\nand flood. Certainly it will not be possible for all libraries\nand archives to preserve in film all their holdings, but it\nshould be not only possible but quite practical for every de~\npository to accept responsibility to civilization for some part\nof its holdings, dove-tailing with the part that other libraries\ntake responsibility for. Those holdings -- let us begin with the\npershable newspaper files -- need be micro-copied only once,\nthe negative stored in safety, and two positives made from it.\nOne positive would then become available for lending, and\nthereby would be added not only to the permanent resources of\nthe library itself but also through loan to the liquid resources\nof the world. If a number of libraries accepts this responsibility,\neach for some part of its holdings, and receives in exchange a\nborrower's equity in the copies made by all other libraries, its\nown investment in the preservation of its own materials will re~\nturn to it many fold in its own access to the corresponding\nmicro-copied holdings of other centers. If a circle of twenty\nlibraries should each organize, and within its present budget\neach should shift a small percentage from the purchase of\ntexts on paper to the transfer of some of its unique holdings\nfrom paper to film and should agree to a mutuality of borrowing\nand lending, the resulting enrichment would be direct and immed~\niate, and the long-term effect would reach beyond the field of\nlibrarianship.\n\nAll over the world we see barriers to intercourse\nrising, barriers to the movement of goods, obstacles to the\nmovement of ideas. Here is a technique upon which we can base\nan institution that will work the other way, -- toward a freer\nintercourse in the world community.\n\nThe legitimate equities of authors as fixed by copy~\nright need not suffer. The proper reward due to the custodians\nfor their acquisition and careful custody of their treasures\nmust always be accorded them. But neither copyright nor owner~\nship rights should be exploited piratically and to the detri~\nment of full freedom of communication among mankind.\n\nRobert C. Binkley\n\n\n"

    "text": "\n\nJOINT COMMITTEE ON MATERIALS FOR RESEARCH\n\n\n        Circular to Members and Correspondents\n      \n\nProfessor Gras has drafted the following statement covering the\nwork of the sub-committee on categories of material:\n\n1. General objectives.\n\nThe Sub-Committee should endeavor to develop a\nconsciousness of the problem of the search for new materials.\nScholars are quite aware of the importance of studying facts,\nbut they do not vizualize the task of discovering and utiliz~\ning materials not already in use. The imagination of the\nscholar has hardly reached this realm of endeavor. In a gen~\neral way, this is the most important task.\n\nThe Sub-Committee should search out persons and\nagencies to discover, preserve, and make available any\nmaterials. This is a difficult task. Indeed, in my mind\nthe work should be turned over to some kind of permanent\nsecretary.\n\n2. Operations.\n\nBy means of negotiation it would be possible for\nthe Sub-Committee to arrange each year for the writing and\npresentation of papers at the meetings of learned societies.\nScholars, librarians, and others could be persuaded to write\narticles for journals.\n\nBut above all it would be necessary to write innumer~\nable letters to individuals: (a) to state what is being done,\nand (b) to indicate what remains to be done. This is an un~\nending task. I should think that it might be continued over\na period of two or three years at least.\n\n3. Costs.\n\nObviously, the costs of operation would depend upon\nthe amount of work done. I should think that from $120 to\n$1,000 a year would be required.\n\nAt the same time, Professors Gras and Quinn have doubted the\nwisdom of separating proposed sub-committee I (Categories) from\nproposed sub-committee I\u00a5 (Education).\n\nQuinn writes: \"My principal criticism of the reorganization lies\nin the fact that I think there should be a more intimate associa~\ntion between numbers 1 & 4. I really believe, on thinking the\nmatter over, that one committee can do more effective work in\neducating the world on the subject of the proper categories of\nresearch material if that same committee has gone through the\nagony of deciding upon its categories. Otherwise sub-committee I\nwould have to furnish material to sub-committee IV, and as I grow\nolder I think anyone who makes one committee grow where two com~\nmittees grew before is doing a great service.\"\n\nIn reply to this observation, I wrote:\n\n\n\"The education of the laity is another problem in which\nrelatively unexplored areas confront us. We must find ways of\nteaching the laity certain things which we want known about\nmaterial, including in the material not only the neglected and\nunusual categories, but also well-established categories of\nmaterials long known and used by the scholars but unappreciated\nby the laity. At every step in initiating the public into this\nmatter, we encounter dangers. Right through our discussions in\nthe committee we can trace the continuous uncertainty in our\nown minds as to how far we should emphasize collection and how\nfar destruction and how much responsibility for selection can\nactually be placed upon the less highly trained individual.\nThis is not a prepared subject. We are not yet prepared to\nteach anybody anything. We must have the help of those who\nunderstand the School of Education and the School of Applied\nSocial Science and the Library School, and when we know what\nwe want to teach, then our campaign will be like that of the\nForeign Policy Association or the Child Health Society, some~\nthing directed toward the people and not toward our colleagues\nof the 'republic of letters'. This is my vision of a task of\neducation. The sub-committee would not engage in it but only\nplan it.\n\nI do not know whether you would agree that a task of\neducation lies before us to this extent. I realize that I\nhave presented these thoughts in what is perhaps too assertive\na language and I frankly confess that I have no fixed opinion\nas to whether the same sub-committee that does this kind of\neducating should also educate the scholars. I am greatly in\nneed of your help in thinking through this problem.\"\n\nThe instructions to the sub-committee on production will not be\nhard to draft, but those of the sub-committee on inventory and\ncollection offer some difficulties.\n\nROBERT C. BINKLEY\n\n\n"

    "text": "\n\nAugust 25, 1938\n\nTo the Members of the Joint Committee:\n\nRecurrently through the years we have raised the\nquestion of policy in destruction of records. A re~\nport on business records gives us some guidance as to\nthe care of that category and the policies of destruc~\ntion to be followed there. We can trust the National\nArchives organization to lay down carefully-studied\npolicies in respect of all federal archives. The\nlocal and state archives are a relatively unstudied\nfield, which has now been ripened for careful policy-\nmaking. Enough of the inventory of county archives\nhas been completed, and work with the state archives\ngone far enough, so that we have some definite material\nwith which to work. Moreover, the Historical Records\nSurvey hae compiled, in connection with its inventory\nwork, the legislation now on the statute books of the\nstates covering the care and destruction of state, local\nrecords.\n\nIs the time not now ripe for us to approach our\nParent Councils to ask them to sponsor a study of this\nkind?\n\nI understand that Dr. Ernest Posner, one-time\narchivist of the Berlin Staatsarchiv and now in disfavor\nin Germany, would be an ideal person to bring to this\nproblem a broad knowledge of archival practice, and that\nhe would be able to put himself into contact with schol~\nars in all fields of learning pertinent to this question\nand to translate their needs into practical policies on\npreservation and destruction. A brief exploratory dis~\ncussion has suggested that $10,000, available as a three-\nyear grant at $3000 a year plus $1000 expenses, would\nprocure thisman's services for this job. Should we not\nconsider this, or some other appropriate action, at the\nnext meeting of the Joint Committee?\n\n\nI have been informed, though unofficially, that the\nProblems and Policy Committee has endorsed our request\nfor $10,000 to study union Cataloguing. Do we not feel\nthat the archival problem is equally ripe for study at\ntime?\n\nRobert C. Binkley\nChairman\n\n\n"

Kellar -- American Historical Association\nRobert C. Binkley -- Joint Committee on Materials for Research\nMortimer Graves -- American Council of Learned Societies\nDoctor Daucherty -- American Council of Learned Societies\n\nThe chairman explained that Rice, representing the\nSocial Science Research Council, could not be present until the\nafternoon session.\n\nTwo memoranda had been distributed: a circular \"The\nCultural Program of W.P.A.\" and a proposed agenda.\n\nBinkley took the chair and explained that the repre~\nsentatives of organized scholarship were to devote the morn~\ning to the study of their side of the problem of securing\nmaximum value from W.P.A. work in the white collar field,\nand that in the afternoon officials of W.P.A. would join\nthem.\n\nThe discussion that followed turned first on the prob~\nlems that seemed general, structural, within any W.P.A.\noperation, regardless of what was to be done with the labor,\nand second, on the content of the program.\n\nPART ONE: ADMINISTRATIVE QUESTIONS\n      \n\nIn the course of this discussion six points were de~\nfined upon which an understanding with W.P.A. would be\ndesirable. The six points were:\n\n1. Personnel. There must be adecuate information given\nto scholars as to the quantity of labor, and its com~\npetence-levels.\n\n(a) Some projects require skill that can be tested\nby examination. Scholars and W.P.A. adminis~\ntration might come to an understanding on the\nmeaning of W.P.A. labor classifications, and\n\nthe adequacy of examinations or other\nmethods used.\n\n(b) In some cases it is very important that no\none should be assigned to the project with~\nout prior interview and acceptance by spon~\nsor. The element of prior interview with\n      \n\n        sponsor is an essential part of plan for a\nproject which involves the use of W.P.A.\nlabor for work with the regular employees\nof an institution such as a library, or which\ninvolves contact of W.P.A. labor with the\npublic under conditions that involve the cred~\nit and reputation of an institution, such as\na historical society, or which involves en~\ntrusting W.P.A. workers with materials or\nrecords of special rarity or value.\n\n2. Coordination of Scholarly with W.P.A. Organization.\n\nThe problem was described as that of establishing a\ncircuit from W.P.A. national organization to nation~\nal representatives or organized scholarship, and thence\nthrough the two hierarchies to the meeting of local W.\nP.A. administration with scholars on the ground. Var~\nious ways of establishing such a circuit were discussed,\nsuch as:\n\n(a) a series of brief policy pamphlets, cleared\nwith W.P.A. and circulated among scholars,\nor\n\n(b) methods of clearing plans in advance through\nW.P.A. and then giving notice to the scho~\nlarly world through journals, or\n\n(c) some kind of committee structure.\n\nLingelbach pointed out that there would have to be\nofficial recognition by W.P.A. of such an organization.\n\nThe problem of objectives was likewise regarded as a\nmajor one. Before objectives can be popularized, scholars\nmust be clear in their own minds as to what they want, and\nalso as to clearing arrangements. Perhaps some help could\nbe got by showing what has been done in certain localities.\n\n3. Types of Project from Standpoint of Administration.\n\nThe different types of project will require different\nmethods of cooperation. There are at least two classes\nof working situations. One may be called the A program,\nthe other the B program. In the A program the object is\nto get personnel with specific competence. This often\n\ninvolves working within a going organization, such as\nlibrary or university department or laboratory. It is\nhere that the \"prior interview before assignment\" dis~\ncussed above is most necessary.\n\nIn the B program the projects are of the engineer~\ning type, and the factory method is used; for example,\nintexing the population census records to aid in admin~\nistration of social security legislation.\n\nThe relation of the scholar to these two types of\nprojects was discussed. In the A type, or university\nproject, the university may set up a blanket project\nmerely vetting the nominal sponsorship of some public\nagency in case the university is not tax-supported. But\nin the B type the scholar may merely give general advance\nadvice, have no personal contact vith operations, and\nthen utilize the finished product when it emerges (Cf.\nCleveland Newspaper Digest and Historical Records Survey\ninventories)\n\nPossibly the national arts projects, such as collect~\ning folklore material or interviews with living slaves,\nmay be another type.\n\n\"A\" type of project. (Prior interview before assign~\nment usually necessary)\n\n1. Blanket university project: principle of\ncraft operation; Scholars provide super~\nvision and get aid in their research.\n\n2. Projects which involve working within a\ngoing organization. Administrator (as\nof historical society) helps with super~\nvision, and accomplishes objectives of\nhis institution.\n\n\"B\" type of oroject. (scholars give advice, but\nW.P.A. administers)\n\n1. The factory type of project, with many\nworkers of lower level of training doing\nwork prepared for them by careful job\nanalysis.\n\nThe national project, which can put into\neffect a policy that must be nation-wide\nto be effective (The Imprints Survey is a\ncombination of these)\n\n4. Types of Project from the Standpoint of Organized\n      \n\n        Scholars' Participation in Planning and Execution.\n\n(a) It seemed that in some cases scholars could\nhelp by working out a type project, which\ncould then be adapted to variant local con~\nditions (Example: real property inventory)\n\n(b) In other cases it might be that the scholar\norganization could help in finding the par~\nticular individuals in the scholarly world\nwhose advice and interest would be most im~\nportant, and in interesting the individual\nin the problem.\n\n(c) In some cases the important thing would be\nto interpret expertence and evaluate what has\nbeen done in the light of problems of future.\n\n5. Information\n      \n\nAll were agreed that there should be more ef~\nfective clearing of information about development in the\nW.P.A. program itself, and in other places. There seemed\nto be a need for\n\n(a) A clearing house of information\n\n(b) A circular or information sheet to speed the\nflow of information.\n\n6. Publication\n      \n\nThe publishing industry cannot now take care of\nthe product of professional scholars because the editions\nof scholarly work are too small for commercial profit,\nhence scholars go around for subsidy. Principal costs of\npublishing in small editions are labor costs. W.P.A.\nmight utilize relief labor. Quantity of product when fac~\ntory system is used with maximum efficiency is so great\nthat no other way is open than to multiply with relief\nlabor.\n\nIf relief labor multiplies the product by mimeograph\nor otherwise, there must be a clear-cut policy regarding\ndeposit. The Historical Records Survey is a model in this\nrespect, with its national, regional and local depositories.\nSome products will call for deposit according to special\nfield interests as material on transportation in the lib~\nraries that have collections on this subject (as Michigan,\nStanford)\n\nThe development of sound policy in W.P.A. is obstruc~\nted by some administrative or legal difficulty. The Gov~\nernment Printing Office claims a monopoly. If local spon~\nsor purchases equipment for putting products of W.P.A.\nlabor into book form the W.P.A. labor can operate the\n\nequipment, but this part of the planning lags. Wasteful~\nness of present situation. W.P.A. should bring out\nmaterial that commercial trade will not publish.\n\n\nW.P.A. should carry a project all the way through;\nthere is no use in leaving it for someone to publish. It\nis wasteful to utilize sponsor contribution as publication\nfund.\n\nKellar feels that Binkley's suggestions are rett\nmuch of an urban program; he would like to fave ae\nrural orogram. Two things were suggested: one,\nwhich might be supplementary to the urban program,\n\nPART TWO: THE CONTENT OF THE PROGRAM\n      \n\n1. Urban and Rural Program\n      \n\nWhat can be done in regard to the substance?\nKellar feels that Binkley's suggestions are pretty\nmuch of an urban program; he would like to have a\nrural program. Two things are suggested: one,\nwhich might be supplementary to the urban program,\nis an architectural survey in rural districts.\nThe American Association of Museums has done things\nwith famous houses, the National Park Service on\nsites, etc., but Kellar wants ordinary houses, barns,\nmills, factories. In Virginia Kellar found out some\nrather interesting things which in a national survey\nwould throw much light on our cultural development.\n(20-mile strip with one particular type of architec~\nture.) Lydenberg suggests comparing these areas\nwith Kurath's Linguistic Atlas. The second thing\nis that in rural districts there have developed a\nvery interesting handicraft and inventive ideas\nwhich are not found in the Patent Office. Each com~\nmunity has developed certain tools and ways of do~\ning things. Why not a national survey of handicraft,\nand inventions which are not in the Patent Office?\nThis connects with the museum type of activity and\nthe Index of American Design.\n\n2. Library Program\n      \n\n(Shows Resources of Southern Libraries). Could\nthis also be done for the other three parts of coun~\ntry -- middle West, Pacific Coast and Northeast?\n\nThe compiling, editing and issuing in book form\nof the national union catalogue is a good job for\nW.P.A. It should include Canada. We must mobilize\nAmerican holdings for exchange purposes abroad, as\nwe will have to bargain with the people abroad.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 12:15 for lunch.\n\nSaturday, Jan. 21, 1939\n\nAfternoon session:\n\nPresent:\n\nCharles Judd -- National Youth Administration\nWilfred de St. Aubin -- Project Control\nWilliam Lingelbach -- American Council of Learned Societies\nHerbert A. Kellar -- American Historical Association\nMerle Curti -- National Council for the Social Studies\nHarvey Becknell -- Division of Social Research\nH.M. Lydenberg -- Director New York Public Library\nMr. Botkin -- Federal Writers' Projects\nLuther H. Evans -- National Director Historical Records Survey\nStuart A. Rice -- Social Science Research Council\nVincenzo Petrullo -- Works Progress Administration\nDoctor Daucherty -- American Council of Learned Societies\n\nBinkley summarized for the representatives of W.P.A.\nthe points covered in the morning session, directing at~\ntention particularly to 1b (prior interviews) and 6 (pub~\nlications:)\n\nST. AUBIN: Mimeographing and distribution of project re~\nports are customary; but setting up projects specifically\nfor the duplication of material in printing is not done.\n\nBECKNELL: We are not allowed to do printing as parts of\nprojects. The responsibility for publication is not up\nto W.PA.\n\nLYDENBERG: We would earnestly recommend that the W.P.A.\nauthorities give serious thought to the development of\nmeans of distribution.\n\nLAWRENCE: This publication problem is one of the most ser~\nious things holding up the program of W.P.A. This should\nbe brought to the attention of the Joint Committee on Print~\ning. We have tried to get it considered and then we have\ngone ahead and published the stuff anyway, so that the\nwork will not be wasted.\n\nLYDENBERG: If you can get an expression of opinion asked\nof our Joint Committee on Materials for Research, you can\nget our enthusiastic support. But it should be asked for.\n\nLAWRENCE: When W.P.A. was first set up there were no\nrestrictions on printing, copyright or similar matters.\nThe sponsors did not know whether they could publish or\nnot. Now W11 is the report telling what is permissible\n\nin publishing. In New York the mayor purchsed multilith\nequipment, and relief labor will be used to operate these\nmachines to turn out the W.P.A. stuff in editions of a~\nbout 200 copies\n\nBECKNELL: On research projects six copies are required\nto be sent to the W.P.A. in Washington. Two copies go\nto the W.P.A. library, one to L.C., the others go to\nnational agencies interested in the subject covered.\n\nBINKLEY: The question of what form the final project will\ntakee reacts all the way back through the various procedures\ntaken.\n\nST. AUBIN: The local situation also is bad in connection\nwith publication.\n\nBOTKIN: The publishers are lookine to the Arts people\nfor books. In New York City, on the Writers Project, we\nhave a lithograph press but we cannot print books on it.\nHow are the publishers going to feel about the extention\nof W.P.A. into publication?\n\nBINKLEY: In the research field there is no competition\nwith publishers. Two hundred copies is the usual edition\nand usually subsidy is required. Our problem is to clar~\nify, to rationalize somewhat the mimeograph procedures.\n\n\\[Binkley then suggested that further discussion of\nthe six points on administration be deferred until Mrs.\nKerr and Mr. Gill could be present, and that the repre~\nsentatives of W.P.A. inform the scholar group of their\npicture of the substance of the program.\\]\n\nST. AUBIN: White collar projects are defined roughly in\nto three categories. In the public administration field\nwe have the administrative tool, the recording of some\nphysical asset, for use almost entirely for public of~\nficials rather than for public information. (Shade tree\ninformation for the Park Department, etc.) (2) the deal~\ning with old records, primarily to facilitate reference\nand sometimes the preservation of these records. (3)\nthe installation of a more effective system of record\nkeeping; revision in some cases, or reorganization of\na filing system.\n\nThe primary function is the indexing, arranging,\nfiling, etc. of old records; then the creation of an ad~\nministrative tool; and the installation of a new or re~\n\nvision of an old system to make it more usable. So that\nthe administrative tool is only one of those fields.\n\nThese three are in the urban areas because the re~\ncords are there and also the workers. The Division of\nSocial Research is also interested in this, including\nStatistics and Research. We also have the broad field\nof engineering services, which I am leaving out right\nnow. They are tied up with aeoasTyes aving out right\nnow. They are tied up with deodetic surveys, geologi~\ncal surveys, etc. They have set up more and more stand~\nar\n        ds which W.P.A. generally follows.\n\nBINKLEY: Is public administration one part only of your\npicture, or is that inclusive?\n\nST. AUBIN: All forms of record projects other than those\nunder Statistical Review.\n\nBECKNELL: Actually research is done in many cases for\npublic administration purposes. The difference is that\nany project may have one or both objectives: an improved\nrecord for service purposes, and a record for research\n\n        \n        purposes. The category of Research, Statistical and Sur~\nvey is broken down by subject matter rather than by pur~\npose.\n\nLAWRENCE: Some of this work is not work dealing com~\npletely with records. It may be that it is the establish~\nment of a new record through assembling data from the\nfield or from other records. Cumulative records from\nschools, or various types of educational testing, is\nanother kind of record which may result. Then we have\nproduction and service projects, which are not in the\nnicture, -- projects producing clothes for the needy, etc.\n\nST. AUBIN: Service projects are almost all record~\ncreating, but the primary purpose is for service.\n\nBINKLEY: There are then three major divisions: public\nadministration; research statistical and survey; and\nrecord-creating projects.\n\nJUDD: The most difficult problem we encounter at pre~\nsent is to get some knowledge of our young people. We\nhave no adequate records of them. We started a census\nof young people; this was changed to a survey. There\nis not any record that can be relied on regarding unem~\nployment of youth, etc. We have no knowledge of their\n\nexperience up to this point; we have no understanding\nof the youth problem. An important social move could\ncome about if we had a knowledge of what the situation\nis, but we do not have it. CCC camps do keep records.\n\nEVANS: Could local W.P.A. projects give you a city-\nwide sample of this type of information?\n\nJUDD: A recent report on people who left school during\n1937-1938 in New York State has been done. An attempt\nwas made to follow these young people up with interviews,\nthis is a huge task.\n\nBECKNELL: A study of urban youth in six or seven large\ncities has been completed in the Division of Social Re~\nsearch. About 40,000 young people were covered.\n\nJUDD: Nothing has been done on the rural areas.\n\n\nBECKNELL: There are some studies being done on rural\nyouth surveys.\n\nBINKLEY: This suggests a seventh administrative point.\nWhat about the use of interview technique in connection\nwith record-producing work?\n\nBECKNELL: A project supported by evidence of public sup~\nport can do interviewing. However it has been generally\nagreed that during the period of the census-taking, W.P.\nA. will not go into interviewing.\n\nJUDD: Doorbell ringing is out. The interview technique\nused in New York State produced a lot of very valuable\ninformation, despite the deficiencies of the technique.\nNothing is known about our schools of today or forty\nyears ago; what was actually done in the school is not\nknown.\n\nEVANS: My people have gone into the inventorying of\nschool records. They are usually more poorly kept than\nthe county and city records, and there are a lot of gaps.\nWe might make an inventory of records of the institu~\ntions of higher learning. We are thinking of doing this.\n\nBINKLEY: In Cleveland we want to know whether there are\nenough of the old student record cards left to do any~\nthing.\n\n\nBOTKIN: I can speak mainly for the Folk Lore field. We\ndeal with unwritten records and collecting oral materials.\nPhonographic recordings, and photographic recording of\nmusical instruments, etc. We use interview method also.\nWe also have the problem of storing and duplicating mater~\nial. The problem of classification and indexing of this\nmaterial has to be met. Ours is chiefly a rural field.\nIt is not the conventional folk lore type, but more of\nthe contemporary folk lore. There is poor supervision\nin the rural areas.\n\nKELLAR: Do you try to work through the schools, churches\netc.?\n\n\nBOTKIN:: We have tried, but not so good. We do use NYA\nrecreation units. The Arts project is doing the Index\nto American Design. The Guide books do not use all the\nmaterial they gather, and we have a file of discarded\nmaterial kept. Socio-ethic studies are also being made\nby Federal Writers, but the meterial is much too bulky\nfor complete publication.\n\nEVANS: Our basic job is to make an inventory of the\npublic archives in this country. We can analyze types\nof items found in those records, their sources, etc.\nYou have to know your different procedures and functions\nof government so that you can recognize when records are\nmixed up in a series. We now make a complete statement\nof the organization and functions of units of government,\nnot only for the present time but since the beginning of\ngovernment in this country. We started out with the i~\ndea that we were not going to do any research, for ob~\nvious reasons, but ve are now training our people to\nhandle the research type of work. As time goes on we\nmay be able to do a little bit more along research lines.\n\nBINKLEY: Lydenberg, having seen this picture of the\nwork W.P.A. is doing, and seen some of the problems\ndefined, what strikes you as the area or field or type\nof thing we ought to help with, and where can they best\nhelp us?\n\nLYDENBERG: In such work as the Historical Records Sur~\nvey. As these results are obtained they should be put\ndown in material form at fitting times and be put at the\ncommand of interested users by proper distribution at\nstrategic points.\n\nBINKLEY: The public library should certainly be served\nby this program.\n\nSt. AUBIN: The various library projects are closely tied\nin with libraries themselves through the Library Consul~\ntant.\n\nLYDENBERG: In the Imprints Survey the library gives and\nreceives service. I hope a set amount of the tangible\nresults of these efforts to get benefit from enforced and\ndirected public employment of white-collar people will\nbe preserved, so that in the future we will have some\nknowledge of what has been done. There is where the Joint\nCommittee on Materials for Research comes in very emphati~\ncally. It has a direct responsibility to urge the con~\nsideration of this problem so that the essential results\nof this form of activity may be preserved for the next\ngeneration. Your tools are for present day use, but the\nresults of the other things ought to be distributed prop~\nerly.\n\nBINKLEY: This brings us back to point 6 -- publication.\nFrom the library standpoint we are back to the question\nof what can be done to bring about a reconsideration in\nthe Joint Committee on Printing or the Government Print~\ning Office of that rule which closes the door... That\nis a critical and crucial matter. It has been suggested\nthat our Joint Committee on Materials for Research would\nbe willing to go before the Joint Committee on Printing\nor to do whatever is appropriate to break through that\nblockade.\n\nST. AUBIN: We do not give favorable consideration to\nthe printing of reports as such. There is some duplica~\ntion, but it is regarded as the obligation of the spon~\nsor as an evidence of interest, and because of the\nGovernment Printing Office ruling. When projects are\nsubmitted where publication is necessary, some local\nbody must take care of the publication. Other projects\ncan have the products mimeographed.\n\nEVANS: There is an old ruling about multigraphing, etc.\n\nBINKLEY: The effect of this rule is that the results are\nless valuable because only a little bit of it can be\nprinted.\n\nEVANS: The work of a project will be much more better\norganized, of higher quality, and the morale of the work~\ners will be better, if they know they are working with\nthe publication objective.\n\nRICE: This problem of printing comss up in the whole\ngovernment service. There are never enough funds to\nprint. The thing that surprises me a little is the\ncontrol of the Government Printing Office over the W.~\nP.A. projects.\n\nEVANS: It is the General Accounting Office. But the\nJoint Committee on Printing does control emergency field\nprinting.\n\nBINKLEY: Meanwhile we are hampered because the non-\nlabor costs are too high. Yet here is a huge non-lab~\nor cost oressing down all the time.\n\nLAWRENCE: We have many people in New York who know\nprinting, who could be used to reproduce the materials.\n\nLYDENBERG: Would it be fair to let me move as the ex~\npression of opinion of this organization that the JCMR\nventure to recommend to the W.P.A. administration that\nfor the purposes of research it take care to see that an\nannual report of its activities is rendered to the proper\ngovernment authorities, and that it endeavor to secure\nfrom the proper government authorities authorization to\nprint and distribute, either through ordinary trade chan~\nnels or through some of the forms of near-printing, such\nresults of its investigation as in the view of a proper\ncommittee appointed ad hoc may be judged worthy of dis~\ntribution for those who are interested in research. If\nthe W.P.A. made a proper accounting, the next genera~\ntion could see that such and such activity had been car~\nried on. Results that are worthy of publication can be\nheld up to the proper authorities as indications of the\ntype of material turned out, and will have their bene~\nfits extended in material fashion if they are issued\nadequately for the prospective students and users.\n\nBINKLEY: My thought on that is that while it would be\nimportant for certain of the W.P.A. products, it would\napply to a narrow part of the program. For most of our\nprogram we must know in advance and plan in advance what\nthe product will be. This is not true of craft research,\nbut it is true of factory product. We should not go in~\nto projects of the factory scale unless we know that the\nwhole discipline will be adequate to give a specific re~\nsult carried to an appropriate form, and if the appropri~\nate form is an edition of two hundred copies of a set of\nbooks, the project must produce that too. In the setting\nup of a job, if you are going to use relief labor to car~\n\nry it to book form, that labor should be in the picture\nfrom the beginning.\n\nBECKNELL: In many parts of the country there are no\ntrained people to do this work. Will that not inter~\nfere with our setting projects?\n\nBINKLEY: You can train unskilled people to do multi~\ngraphing. The thing that holds back the full develop~\nment of this is a little set of regulations that appear\naccidentally in the program. Just exactly what action\nis necessary to get over this hurdle?\n\nEVANS: Someone over in Procedures can tell you that.\n\nLAWRENCE: Sponsors do not have funds for publication.\nThey are in the same position as the federal government.\n\n\\[Mrs. Kerr and Mr. Gill entered.\\]\n\nBINKLEY: We have heard what W.P.A. is doing. Now let\nus ask this question: What, from W.P.A's angle, would\nyou like to have emerge as a form of cooperation and as\na field of cooperation, if the groups that are in touch\nwith the various learned societies, are to help? What\ncan we offer and how can it best be done?\n\nBECKNELL: At a conference of state and regional coordin~\nators, four points developed as essential for a good pro~\ngram in the research field:\n\n(1) A knowledge of the character and size of our\nwhite-collar load, and of the qualifications\nof workers.\n\n(2) More knowledge of the type of vast projects\nand the results obtained therefrom.\n\n(3) Knowledge of possible fields of project activity;\nWhere are the gaps and how to be filled.\n\n(4) Knowledge of possible sponsorship of projects\nof this type.\n\nBINKLEY: Here is our list: (reads 7 points including\ninterview) The six (or seven) points that emerged in our\ndiscussion fit right in with Becknell's four points.\n\nPETRULLO: Let us add consideration of new techniques\nwhich may have been developed or will be developed. And\nalso the possibility of getting the academic people in\nany particular field to get together and map out good\nprojects. It is at present impossible to coordinate the\nvarious archaeological projects in the states so that\nthey contribute to the general field of archaeology.\n\nBINKLEY: This is the Social Science Research Council\nProblem.\n\nKELLAR: Would it be possible to make inquiry of the\nvarious sciences as to just what they want done?\n\n\nEVANS: If in addressing this question to the academic\ngroups you emphasize the relief and mass labor aspect,\nthey are going to take away a lot of problems they think\nwe cannot solve with relief people. Let them give us\nthe full list and then let us decide whether we can\ntackle their problems.\n\nKELLAR: That is better.\n\nBINKLEY: Often our work results in bringing information\nup to a higher level of accessibility, but not to bring\nit to a sharp point of finish. I think if we show them\nactual work being done, and then ask them what in their\nown field they want done, we can put the idea over. The\nIndex to Research Projects would be a bad place to draw\nconclusions as to just what the W.P.A. can do.\n\nST. AUBIN: Would it not be worthwhile to suggest to mem~\nbers of societies that they become acquainted with actual\nprojects in operations? They would see the possibilities\nto a much greater degree.\n\nPETRULLO: Under the present regulations the project has\nto be sponsored by a public institution. So most of the\nprivate institutions are handicapped, even though they\ncould give good supervision to the projects.\n\nBINKLEY: If we are restricted by inappropriate rules on\nsponsorship, this program will bog down very quickly.\nThe thing we are interested in does not correspond to\nthe particular distribution of function in government.\nBut if we take the idea that public sponsorship may be\nnominal we can go ahead. If a state project is to be\noperated by the University of Chicago, but must be spon~\nsored by the State College, I think it could be to get\nnominal sponsorship.\n\nRICE: Isn't it already so nominal that it fails to serve\nits purpose?\n\nKERR: The co-sponsor is become increasingly important.\nHe may be private. I know that the named sponsor often\nknows very little about the actual operation of projects.\nIn many cases we would not have had projects at all if\nit were not for nominal sponsorship. In other words\nthis program has burst the bonds of regular government\nfunction. I think that so far the President is not will~\n\ning to give up the idea of sponsorship. It is a safe~\nguard, an indication that the public wants it.\n\nJUDD: At a conference of regional planning boards, it\nwas proposed to launch a device of reporting on the re~\nsearch programs carried on by state agencies in the states.\nOne purpose is to bring the research people and planning\nboards into closer relationship. This might be used here\nto get proper sponsorship. The planning boards could\nget advice from the states.\n\nST. AUBIN: In general the problem of sponsorship has\nbeen solved. A public agency is usually available and\nactual technical supervision can come from another in~\nterested institution. Any general research program in\na place can be sponsored by a public agency in the place.\nJurisdiction is not entirely solved, but it is so gener~\nal in the field of research that it does not often be~\ncome a problem.\n\nJUDD: Don't you have to make the city aware of the val~\nue of this research? Why not use these planning boards\nfor this?\n\nLAWRENCE: There are very few good projects that are\ngoing begrine for spomsorship.\n\nBINKLEY: I am convinced that when the university facul~\nties get interested there will be no difficulty in spon~\nsorship.\n\nBECKNELL: At our conference it was not a problem of\nsponsorship, but of getting the people who know the prob~\nlems to help us in planning. I think that the develop~\nment of these programs is going to have to be on the basis\nof fields of activity.\n\nLAWRENCE: The field of education will be different from\nthat in public health. Perhaps the Joint Committee can\nfill in programs in various fields which the Committee\nmight set up. In New York City in a given field -- edu~\ncation, for instance, -- we have taken our sponsoring\nagencies and listed them. Then we list the types of\nactivities possible in a W.P.A. program in that field.\n\nBINKLEY: The JC is now only one of many agencies inter~\nested in W.P.A. Does W.P.A. want cooperation from\nthese bodies? If so, how can it best be organized among\nour bodies and in W.P.A.? Where in the program is co~\noperation wanted?\n\nKERR: I think you know how enthusiastically I am in ac~\ncord with such a conference of this kind. It has the\nnature of a second wind. We are beginning a second and\nmuch more fruitful phase of the whole works program. As\nfor the necessity of conferring with each other there\ncan be no room for doubt. I think anything we can do\neven in the realm of long time planning should be under~\ntaken at once. We are stopping now to take stock and\nin the light of that to do better in the future, so\nthat a review of past functions is very vital. I like\nto have our planning done in bigger units and longer in\npoint of time. I like to see the relationship of smal~\nler activities to the larger field better worked out.\nI would like to have regional thinking in some fields.\n\nGILL: I second everything Mrs. Kerr has said. I think\nin the past the research program with local projects has\nbeen very spotty. I am wondering if we could not local~\nize what we have tried to do from time to time -- such\nthings as the coordinating committee of three years ago --\nof bringing in people from time to time who were tremen~\ndously interested in the whole program in general. You\nget a fresh start in that way. Can that be done on a\nregional basis and also for local situations? In many\nways the first coordinating committee carried back in~\nto their field a knowledge of the program and how it\ncould be adapted to their needs. They should be stand~\ning committees with people who had taken time to be\nhelpful. Could we not utilize people in those groups\nas local advisors without administrative responsibilities?\n\nBINKLEY: Your point looks to the scholars in the dis~\ntrict as the principal people involved.\n\nGILL: Local and district.\n\nRICE: The problem, I think, is finding the people some~\nhow who will do the work, either on a pay basis or vol~\nuntarily. I talked this thing over with Young and Crane\nat the SSRC. Our committee did not do anything. But\nYoung said \"Just what is it you want; do you want an in~\nvestigator or a committee, etc.\" How do you get the\npeople with time and ability to spend the time working\nout a program? How shall we find these holes and plan\nhow to fill them?\n\nLINGELBACH: The committee should know what its relation~\nship should be to the W.P.A. generally. There is no\nuse in working along a line that will have no results.\nI think the committee will function if it knows it is\ndefinitely in cooperation with the right group.\n\nEVANS: My experience is that the way to get help from\nthe right people is to go to them with the problems.\nIn order for them to solve the problems they have to\nknow the field of work. The important thing is to give\nthem the background of our work and let them apply their\nbackground to the solution of the problem. W.P.A.\nshould take the step of going to these people and get~\nting from them the benefit of their experience. I don't\nthink a committee could be set up which would come tO W.~\nP.A. and tell us what to do. There must be a number\nof points of contact. Sometimes people don't know where\nto go in W.P.A. to put their ideas over.\n\nLINGELBACH: Wouldn't it be an advisory body of experts\nsuch as the government has?\n\nEVANS: Are you going to send a problem through some\nstandard channel, such as the JC, or are you going to\nhave certain direct contacts with various groups for\nparticular tyoes of problems? My experience is that\nwhen I have a problem I go various places with it.\n\nLAWRENCE: In New York City we have found that what\nyou said is necessary. We have to ask our sponsors to\nplan projects, but we make little provision for planning\nour own program.\n\nKERR: Ideally the people who have worked longest in\nthese research fields should be the leaders, and W.P.~\nA. should come in behind with the workers and the money.\nBut we don't seem to work in this way.\n\nLINGELBACH: I think it would be a great assistance to\nhave a clearing committee of scholars. We could set up\na committee whose advice would be a great value to W.P.~\nA.\n\nEVANS: You can have these committees and also have special\ncontacts for special problems.\n\nST. AUBIN: Is it not two problems really? You would\nhave one group explaining to the societies some of the\nthings we are trying to do and asking their help; and our\npeople could go into the states and get more help.\n\nPETRULLO: The W.P.A. is a huge research organization\nand yet I don't know even a pamphlet we have put out\nsuch as any Foundation has, to describe its research pro~\ngram. We have no such thing to circulate to the research\n\npeople.\n\nGILL: We have out out the Index to Research Projects.\n\nRICE: W.P.A. has manuals for individual types of pro~\njects.\n\nBINKLEY: The specific problems come up with small units.\nWe could help in specific problems.\n\nGILL: The various societies could give a statement of the\nresearch program and in some way work in the idea that they\nwill give help when requested.\n\nKELLAR: There is a great deal to be gained by having a\ngeneral committee to survey the whole field. You can\nhave special committees for special fields, but there\nshould be a general program with a general committee.\nThe general committee can appoint out the people in lo~\ncal fields for particular help, but you should have a\ngeneral committee.\n\nBINKLEY: Do we want these various committees, and how\nshould they be tied in with W.P.A. at the top and with\npeople at the bottom?\n\nRICE: Would it be possible for the Joint Committee and\nthe National Research Council to appoint a consultative\ncommittee, get funds to have them get together and map\nout a general program, and propose sub-committees for\nspecial things?\n\nBINKLEY: It would be a possibility. We would move from\nbetween broad and particular problems of analysis. We\nneed a broad statement of what can be done which will\ndirect attention of individual scholars to the broad pro~\ngram. Then we want a kind of continuous contact, and\nthat is where the function of suggesting or designating\nspecific people can take place. Is there anything inter~\nmediate between those two things?\n\nBOTKIN: There is a proposal for a central research bur~\neau in the government which would answer many of the\nquestions. It is a central research bureau which will\nact as clearing house for all research -- private and pub~\nlic through the country. It will index everything that\nhas been done in every field of research.\n\nBINKLEY: I am suspicious of that, because it would have\nto be set up in terms of past tradition of research and\nwe are looking for a new thinking on a new problem.\n\nBOTKIN: If something is not done to indicate public ap~\nproval of the work of the Arts Projects we will not have\nany people to give you to work with.\n\nKERR: If you are asking me if the program is going on,\nI believe fully and completely the program is going on.\nI have every confidence in this program and we must prove\nits worth to the country. I don't feel any apprehen~\nsion about the continuance of these projects. Another\nanswer is that whether or not we continue, we would still\ndo as we are doing now. We would still make plans and\ncontacts.\n\nBINKLEY: We are going to need a point of contact with\nyour organization (W.P.A.) for any further develop~\nment here. It must be something simple; it will be nec~\nessary that somebody can say \"Yes\" or \"No\" to a plan\nat a given state of formation. What can you do in your\norganization to establish a point for liason? We can\nthen hammer out a system. We must have contact at the\nstage of policy.\n\nGILL: Mrs. Kerr and I agree to accent our responsibility.\nIn a week or ten days we ean give you an answer. The\nneed for such a thing is clear. You want an individual\nthrough whom W.P.A. research policies can be contacted.\n\nBINKLEY: Yes, then we can ficure out a way of clearing\nthe channel in our organization.\n\nRICE: I think that on both sides here there is an un~\nprecedented opportunity to effect vitally the whole fu~\nture of social science in the United States. It is a\nmajor proposition here.\n\nBINKLEY: If we should decide that these initiatives\nshould come together as an advisory committee to W.P.A.\nwould you, Mrs. Kerr, be willing to examine that as a\nbasis Of cooperation?\n\nKERR: Yes.\n\nMr. Gill and Mrs. Kerr then left the meeting.\n\nBINKLEY: Well, what shall we do? This job is so much\nbigger than the Joint Committee that I think we must not\nthink of it as a Joint Committee activity merely.\n\nRICE: I think the essential problem is to find the men\nwith ability and interest who have the time to do this\njob; men who can represent the academic groups. Two\nor three years ago we had two or three goodmen but we\ncould not get response from the social science side.\nThere should be a long session held by some selected\npeople who could meet for a week and work something out.\n\nPETRULLO: W.P.A. can offer not only workers but an op~\nportunity. It is a job placement idea. We have the ob~\nstacle of people thinking research cannot be done with\nW.P.A. and of people asking what they are going to get\nout of it.\n\nRICE: But you need some general planning within the var~\nious fields.\nBINKLEY: If we think a session is the thing, I think it\ncan be arranged. Lingelbach emphasizes the creation of\nan advisory board with some kind of semi-official status\nin W.P.A. Rice suggests the importance of getting\nsome coordinated thinking in a session. Someone has\nproposed the use of a contact man or executive official\nof some kind.\n\nJUDD: I am satisfied that we have to lean out to bring\ntogether some people who are not yet together. You had\nspecialists in various fields centralizing themselves\nin national organizations in that field. That proved\nto be not satisfactory, so Councils became established.\nSomehow the Councils have to get together. The government\nstarted out with a whole scattered series of undertakings\nand now wants to centralize and coordinate them. We\nrecommended that there be a smaller coordinating council\ncreated inside the federal government. It seems to me\nyou want focussing of the technical people and a focus~\nsing of W.P.A. I feel that your coordinating commit~\ntee ought to recognize all the Councils somehow. There\nis a gradual focussing on both sides that will ultimate~\nly coordinate. It should include W.P.A. and the Coun~ \ncils (who should do the centralizing for their own par~\nticular organizations). I would like to see the process\nof focussing rather than centralizing. I don't believe\nthe ordinary academic man understands at all what is\ngoing on in other research agencies. The universities\nspend $50,000,000 a year; industry spends $100,000,000\nin their research laboratories; nobody knows about ec~\nonomic research; the government spent in 1937 $120,000,~\n000 on research. The academic man thinks he is the cen~\n\nter of research, but he is not. The interesting thing\nis that all these agencies are in competition. They\nare in competition for personnel. Scattered efforts at\ncoordination will not be successful. In the social\nsciences there is no coordination. The natural sciences\nare much better organized.\n\nRICE: I think Binkley has made a contribution which\nhas not been brought out. Binkley has pointed out and\nshown that you can put certain essential parts of the\nwhole research structure on a mass production basis, not\ninthe finishing touches but in the mass part. There is\na difference between interpreting research and implement~\ning it.\n\nBECKWELL: The W.P.A. in the state offices now can\nhandle the thing if you can set it up. They know much\nmore about what they are doing now.\n\nKELLAR: I would like to suggest that a committee of three\nbe designated to go ahead and formulate a committee.\nBinkley, Lingelbach and Rice. I think there should be\na representative of this committee from each of the lead~\ning social sciences, someone who will really work. Have\na full-time secretary for the committee, and funds to\nmeet several times a year. Let Binkley head it.\n\n\\[Meeting adjourned\\]\n\n\n"

INTELLECTUAL ORGANIZATION\n\nIt is the purpose of this memorandum to propose a major\nfield of exploration and activity for the American National Committee\non Intellectual Cooperation. While this work might be regarded as an\nexpansion of the task of reporting on intellectual organization in the\nUnited States, a task mentioned in the agenda of the last meeting of\nthe committee, it would actually go far beyond the making of a mere\nreport, and would become an enterprise that wovld bring into focus all\nthe varied activities of the committee.\n\nThe problem and the proposed project will define them~\nselves if we start with the assumption that there is in the world a body\nof specific institutions within which intellectual cooperation takes\nplace. These institutions include everything from education and re~\nsearch to entertainment and publishing. They constitute, in a sense,\na world of their own.\n\nAs a world of intellectual institutions, they are at\nonce distinguished from and related to two other worlds, -- the worlds\nof power, and of debts and markets.\n\nThe world of power, -- the political world, -- has been stud~\nied as a whole. Its processes have been examined; its history and its\nphysiology are analyzed in whole libraries of books, descriptive and\nanalytical. The same can be said of the economic world.\n\nHowever, most of our descriptive and analytical study of\nthe intellectual world has been devoted to the product rather than\nthe process. Our studies of this world have borne the same relation\nto the study I propose that geography bears to politics, or expert tea-\ntasting to economics. Our scholarly literature, critical and histor~\nical, is in the main a travel literature. We have indeed collected\nmuch information about the functioning of different parts of intellec~\ntual organization. In the field of education, for instance, and per~\nhaps in the functioning of the press, a great amount of information\nhas been collected. But we do not have, even in outline, a conspectus\nof the organization as a whole.\n\nWe have at hand the cumulated results of the thinking\nof many generations in analyzing the economic and political worlds.\nWe know something of the quantities that are involved; we can estimate\nresources and armaments; we have statistics on credits and business\nactivity. We do not all agree in the analysis of the dynamics of these\nworlds, but at least we are accustomed to looking at them as wholes.\nBut we have no corresponding vision of the world of intellectual coop~\neration.\n\nAnd yet intellectual organization is the house in which\nwe live. We have lived in it so long that we think we can take it for\ngranted. We have looked from its windows and described the other houses;\nwe know that some alterations have recently been made. But we lack even\na floor plan of the building as a whole.\n\nWe are aware of great and recent changes in this world\nof intellectual cooperation: radio, movies, literacy, censorship, prop~\naganda, the multiplying of culture languages and of culture centers.\nbusiness formations, as in radio and movies; power formations, as in\nthe totalitarian states, have brought new situations into existence.\n\nOur primary practical concern is with the functioning of\nthis world of intellectual organization. Our interest, as a committee,\nincludes an interest in peace and an interest in prosperity insofar as\nthese affect the intellectual world, and particularly its international\nfeatures. But we are not, primarily, an organization concerned with the\npower world or the economic world. There are many other organizations\nworking there.\n\nLet us take note of two characteristics of the intellec~\ntual world which exhibit its peculiarly international character. First,\nthere is still in existence a world-wide acceptance of the results of\nexperiment in the natural sciences. A scientific experiment, properly\nrecorded in our highly institutionalized system of learned journals, not\nonly has world currency, but world authority. Its credit is better\nthan bank credit; its authority is more definitive and universal than\nthe authority of any judgment of a court of law. The assumption of\ngood faith that obtains in the field of scientific work is the kind of\nassumption that exists only among insiders in a going concern. The\npower world has restricted the jurisdiction of the high court of science,\nit is true. Nothing on race and anthropology can pass in Germany with~\nout the nihil obstat or the praemunire. But in general, the authority\nof the jurisdiction of science is a world authority.\n\nIn the field of intellectual property there is a peculiar\nrelation of public property to international organization. Ror the\npublic domain in intellectual property is international domain. In\npublicly-owned tangibles -- in bridges and roads, buildings and battle~\nships -- public domain concentrates in the object the qualities of sover~\neignty and of property. But intellectual property that is public domain\n\nbecomes something from which no one is excluded. Only the open sea shares\nwith intellectual property the character of international domain. In~\nternational action (as in the interntional copyright) may have the effect\nof diminishing international domain.\n\nOnly in the presence of a clear picture of the function~\ning of this world of intellectual cooperation can a committee such as\nours work effectively. There must be a picture of the present situa~\ntion, a definition of the directions in which we would wish to see the\nsituation change, and then a selection of the acts best calculated to\naccomplish the change.\n\nII. MEASUREMENTS OF ORGANIZED INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY\n\nLet us first consider how far this world of intellectual\norganization permits of measurement. It may be that the objects we seek\nto attain are not measurable, but they are at least related to measurable\nfeatures of the intellectual world.\n\nWe must assume that there is in some way a possible dis~\ntinction between American intellectual onganization on the one hand,\nand international intellectual organization on the other. The simplest\ndistinction, which may be taken as a first approximation, is the distinc~\ntion between events occurring here and abroad. A more refined analysis\nmay then show that some events occurring here belong rather to interna~\ntional than to national intellectual organization, and that some events\noccurring abroad belong to our own intellectual organization.\n\nIn what units can intellectual organization be measured?\nThe simplest are men, money, product, and time. In the publishing in~\ndustry we should inquire, for instance, how many people are employed\nin each of the kinds of writing, how much money is involved in pUblish~\ning and how it is distributed, how many items are published, by how many\npeople they are bought, by how many people they are read, and how much\ntime is involved in the reading. We should inquire how the writers are\nmotivated to write, and the readers to read. So far as possible we\nshould break down these quantities into appropriate classifications.\n\nThe same units of measurement ean be applied to the edu~\ncational system, to the research system, to entertainment, to music,\nradio, moving pictures, lectures, perhaps even to trawel and to mail\ncommunication, if that be adjudged a part of intellectual organization.\nPerhaps even commercial advertising should be accorded some gross meas~\nurement, and certainly the work of propaganda agencies should be given\nat least a quantitative estimate.\n\nInsofar as dollar estimates of quantity can be made, and\nthe particular channels of the flow of money described, the relation\nwith the economic world is clarified. Insofar as the positive action\n\nof government (as in education), and its negative action (as in cen~\nsorship) are defined, the relation of the intellectual world with the\nworld of power is also defined.\n\nWith these gross measurements in hand, and they might\nbe tabulated in huge cross-section charts, it will be possible to\nbegin the analysis of international intellectual organization insofar\nas the intellectual organization of this country shares in it.\n\nIt is at this point that we could bring together the\nanswers to such questions as these: What proportion of newspaper space\nis given over to foreign news; what proportion of teaching time is\ngiven over to the teaching of foreign matters, including such things\nas foreign literatures and international relations; what proportion of\nresearch energy is committed to these fields; in what degree are our\nlibrary resources committed to foreign as against domestic materials?\nWhat preportion of our consumption of intellectual goods comes from\nabroad; what proportion goes abroad; etc. These are broad categories,\nbut in the course of measurement they would be refined.\n\nIf it is possible, even as a crude estimate, to measure\nworld intellectual activity, and set against its quantities the quanti~\nties for America, and the amount of overlap, the quantitative framework\nfor the making of policy will be established.\n\nIII. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\n\nWhen we have the full picture before us, it will be both\npossible and necessary to think rigidly upon the specific objective of\nthe committee.\n\nA very important issue will have to be faced at this\ntime: Is it the object of the committee to use the existing intellec~\ntual organization of the world to accomplish certain effects in the\nworld of power, or to protect the organization and develop it as a value\nin itself?\n\nThese two objectives may prove inconsistent with each\nother. Efforts to use intellectual organization as a means of influ~\nencing power policies may recoil against the organization itself, either\ndirectly, as when an effort to bring pressure to bear in Germany results\nin the withdrawal of Germans from international association, or indi~\nrectly, as in the case of an invitation to governments to restrain in~\nternational name\u2014calling by police power (moral disarmament), which may\nprove a boomerang against full freedom of the press. (Note the re~\nstraints on Dutch and Swiss press in respect of Hitler.) If we are to\nfunction as an unofficial propaganda agency for America, our actions\nmay be received in some quarters with the same attitude that greets\ncommunist and fascist propaganda here. Any of these policies are open\nto us, but we must think them through clearly.\n\nI can only compare our situation to that of the Church\nwhen it faced the difficult problems of adjustment with the world of\nsecular power. Intellectual organization has quietly accomplished in\nthe course of the past century for the world as a whole an intellectual\nunification such as Christianity once accomplished for Western Europe.\nCommunism and fascism may reject part, but they do not reject all, of \nthe bases of world collaboration.\n\nWith our objective defined, and our measurements estab~\nlished, it will be possible to find the critical points for action.\nWe may discover, for instance, that the study of international relations\nin our schools is moving forward without the need of extra pressure,\nbut that the study of modern lengueges is declining and needs help. If\nour figures show this situation, we should concentrate on the point where\nhelp is needed. And so on throughout the whole field.\n\nIn the presence of the magnitudes that our survey would\ndisclose, the resources of our committee must appear very small indeed.\nWe will not spend over many years what it costs to produce one movie.\nIf we undertake to propagate a particular idea by direct action, we must\ndo it with resources that would not suffice to put on the market a new\nbrand of tomato sauce, let alone a brand of cigarettes. But this con~\nsideration should not discourage us; rather it should impress us all\nthe more with the unique importance of the situation we occupy, as the\nonly body in America with terms of reference that fit it for general\nstaff work in the world of intellectual organization. Of all the coun~\ntries from which delegates go to Paris, is there any which is really so\nwell situated to assume freedom from political constraint and financial\nlimitations in intellectual activities?\n\nAt the same time, a consideration of the meagerness of\nour resources should counsel us against drop~in-the-bucket activities,\nand against action and effort in matters where we do not see clearly the\nexact character of the interest we are serving. None of us really knows\nwhether one or another of many possible new systems of international\nintellectual property will serve or obstruct the functioning of the\nsystem of world intellectual cooperation. Neither are we sure what\noperations in promoting abroad the id\u00e9e Americaine will fulfill our de~\nsires, and what ones will kick back, like dollar diplomacy.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nLet us circulate this memorandum, or some other memorandum\non this question, among our membership. Then, after discussion, let\nus see if we can get enough money to employ someone to explore the ground\nof quantitative analysis. Let there be prepared for a meeting next\nDecember a sketch of a chart, with as many figures as possible filled\nin, showing the quantities involved in our American part of the world\nof intellectual organization, and its overlap with the foreign part of\nthis world.\n\nThen let us face our problem of defining our objectives,\nmaking a clear statement of what it is that we wish to maximize in the\nworld. Let policy be clarifled by drafted resolutions. Then, field\nby field, let us hear from our members where action seems most needed.\n\nRobert C. Binkley\n\n\n"

    "text": "\n\nMarch 24, 1939\n\n\nMemorandum on Depository Policy\n\nThe learned world has depended for generations on\nthe book and periodical publishing trade to maintain the flow\nof commmication. However, the bulk of documentation to be\ncurrently communicated now exceeds the capacity of the trade\nto carry and deliver, and of libraries to organize and admin~\nister. This problem arises not only in connection with the\nreports of the International Studies Conferences, but also\nin connection with the vast bulk of near-print documentation\nissued from various governmental agencies and from agencies\nof propaganda, as well as from agencies of research.\n\nAn adequate solution of the problem must economize\nshelf space in libraries, and at the same time make documents\nconveniently accessible to a maximum number of scholars. If\nwe could divide the United States into library regions, and\ntake into account the metropolitan concentrations of popula~\ntion, I believe we would find that twenty or twenty-five\ncopies of any document could be so distributed through the\ncountry that they would be within consultation distance for\neighty to ninety per cent of our scholars. By consultation\ndistance I mean that the document could be brought to the man\nwith sufficient speed to leave the rhythm of his work unbroken,\nor the man could go to the document without a loss of time or\nan expenditure of money that would throw his time budget or\nhis money budget out of balance.\n\nIt is probable that within each of these documentary\nregions no one library would be willing to incur the tremendous\nexpense of shelving or administering all documents of the\nclass under consideration. But it is also quite possible\nthat within each of these library regions the libraries could\nbe brought to agree upon some basis of distribution and to\nallow the distribution to take effect from one center according\nto pre-established plans. Where local or regional union\ncatalogues have been made, as in Denver, Philadelphia, or\nCleveland, the union catalogue might be a convenient center\nfrom which the documents should be distributed to the region.\n\nThis means that we would put the American scholarly\nlibrary system, in respect of a large class of materials, on\na depository basis. It would mean that those who issue docu~\nments under circumstances which do not permit them to give \ndistribution through trade channels would have to renounce,\nin respect of this minimum depository distribution, the pros~\npect of a return from sales price. The costs incurred by the\nlibraries in distributing, cataloguing, shelving and adminis~\ntering the documents would be so substantial that willingness\nto accept and deposit them would be a library contribution\nto the issuer of the documents.\n\nI think this is a question which can be settled more\neasily in a large way than in a small way. I think that if we\nhas a list of mailing addresses and were able to say to any\none who issues near-print material that he wishes to make ac~\ncessible to American scholars and publicists that, by sending\nthe material to these twenty or twenty-five addresses, his\nresponsibility would be ended and he would have achieved na~\ntional distribution, we would rationally supplement trade\nchannels.\n\nThis would not exclude any additional distribution\nor any additional sale; it would still leave the issuers of \ndocuments free to contact any public in any other way that\nmight seem wise. But there would be a certain minima easily\nadministered which would allow us to feel confident that much\nwork, now wasted through inadequate distribution, would here~\nafter be salvaged.\n\nRobert C. Binkley\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "\n\nApril 6, 1939\n\nW.P.A. Newspaper\nIndexing and\nMicro-copying\n\nThe white-collar work relief program has given the\ncustodians of American newspaper files an opportunity and\na responsibility. The opoortunity is to make the contents\nof those files useful beyond anything we have hitherto\nimagined; the responsibility is to do the job with careful\nengineering and greatest economy of effort.\n\nOf two alternatives in the future of this country\none is certain: either there will be such substantial\nre\u00ebmployment in private industry that the problem of\nunemployment will cease to be a matter of pressing public\nconcern, or there will be, either continuously or peri~\nodically, large groups of unemployed who will constitute\na social problem. If there are to be in the future such\nlarge groups of unemployed, of two things one is certain:\neither they will be kept alive without work or work relief\nwill be provided for them. If work relief is to be pro~\nvided for them, then the relief program must include\nwork for white-collar workers because white-collar\npeople constitute an increasing proportion of employable\nlabor and there is no social advantage to be gained in\ntrying to retrain them for physical labor since unem~\nployment hits both classes equally and re\u00ebmployment\nattracts both classes in equal degree.\n\nThe technical problem confronting those who share\nresponsibility for maintaining cultural institutions in\nthis country is to utilize white-collar labor to get\nmaximal social value from it. The common denominator\nof clerical skill is an ability to work with records,\nto improve them, to make the information in them publicly\naccessible. The records to be worked with consist of\ntwo vast reservoirs -- archives and newspaper files. The\narchives have hitherto been unorganized, uninventoried\nand subject to accidential destruction. Work relief\nlabor is organizing the archival resources of the country.\n\nThe Newspaper Resources of the country in the form\nof mewspaper files are less useful than they should be for\nthree reasons: first, the holdings are so scattered\nthrough the country that someone wishing to consult a\ngiven list of newspaper files might have to travel at\ngreat expense from place to place; second, the contents\nof the mewspaper files is not indexed and the labor of\ngetting information from them is therefore very great;\nthird, the newspaper files of the period since 1870 are\nof perishable paper rapidly disintegrating so that in\nmany cases a few searchings of a newspaper file will \ndestroy it for further use.\n\nA comprehensive and well-planned use of relief\nlabor can remedy all these conditions. The technique\nmust be one of indexing and of micro-copying. If a\nnewspaper file is micro-copied, the negative film can\nbe placed somewhere on deposit so that anyone desiring\na copy of the file can procure it by having it made\nfor him. It would be desirable also that two positives\nbe made from that negative, one of them to replace in\nservice the file from which the film was made, and\nthe other to be available for interlibrary loan. Micro-\ncopying handled in this fashion would not only preserve\nnewspaper files but would render them nationally ac~\ncessible. This procedure hes been approved by the\nAmericen Library Association Committee on Photographic\nReproduction.\n\nA more difficult problem but one equally important\nis the indexing of the files. The index, of course,\nwhen made can be micro-copied and made accessible in\nexactly the same way as the original file. But the\ntechnique of indexing is one that presents many new\nproblems. The best example of a successful newspaper\nindexing technique is undoubtedly the New York Times\n      \n\n        Index, but the conditions under which it is prepared\ncannot be reproduced in most cases when relief labor\nis to be used in indexing. This is for three reasons:\nfirst, the workers on the N.Y.T. Index have copies\nof the newspaper which they can mark, cut up, and\ndestroy in the course of their indexing operation.\nThe indexing of back files with WPA labor must be\ndone from unique bound volumes, carefully nursed at\nevery stage of operation. Second, the workers in the\nN.Y.T. Index merely keep up to date with the publica~\ntion of the newspaper. Their rate of speed is given\nto them. The relief workers must plan to carry the\nindexing process more rapidly through many years and\n\nthrough periods when newspaper style differed from that\nwhich obtains today. Third, the staff of indexers working\nin the N.Y.T. Index is a highly-trained group of specialiats,\neach of whom takes care of a certain class of newspaper\nmaterial, whereas the workers available in work relief\nare semi-skilled workers for the bulk of whom it is not\npractical to attempt to reproduce the training that lies\nbehind the N.Y.T. Index efforts.\n\nTo meet the new situation a new conception of opera~\ntions has been evolved which differs from that previously\nused as the factory system differs from the craft system\nin industrial production. Large numbers of semi-skilled\nworkers must have their operations so coordinated and\nchecked that their product has the virtues of accuracy\nand standardization, which the craftsman through his\nindividual training gives to his product.\n\nA large number of indexing operations have been\nundertaken by relief labor. They have followed various\nprinciples and produced results of varied character.\nOne of the leading attempts to solve this problem is\nbeing made at Milwaukee. A group of projects is opera~\nting in Ohio; in Northampton, Oklahoma, Texas and\nSavannah, operations are also under way. The experience\ngained in these various operations ought now to be\nbrought to a point and shared.\n\nThe problem divides itself into two parts; first,\nwhat is it that is desired in a newspaper index; second,\nhow can this desired result be obtained with the means\noffered by the availability of relief labor. It is\npossible that some things that may be desirable are\nnot obtainable with relief labor.\n\nNewspaper indexing has a problem somewhat dif~\nferent from book indexing, first, because in newspapers\nthe index is not paralleled by a table of contents,\nand second, because of the very bulk and heterogeneity\nof the content of the newspapers. The newspaper index\nmust first of all enable a user of the newspaper to\neconomize his reading time by directing him to a speci~\nfic page of the newspaper for information which he\ndesires. Second, it should economize his time by\ninforming him that he need not make an independent\nsearch of the newspaper file for some item he is seeking.\nThe user should be able to go to the index with a cer~\ntain problem and on consulting the index learn one\nof three things: either the location of the pertinent\n\nitem, or the fact that the item he is searching for is\nnot to be found in the newspaper, or that the item he\nis searching for may be in the newspaper, the index being\ninconclusive on the matter. No index can meet all possible\nquestions regarding the content of the newspaper file,\nbut the scope of the index can be so definite that a\nperson using it will know what type of item it controls\nand what type of item it fails to control.\n\nThis being the problem of a newspaper index, the\nplanning of the index falls into three parts: first,\nthe decision as to what material within the newspaper\nis to be controlled and what left uncontrolled; second,\nthe maintenance of checked accuracy as between the index\nentry and the item indexed; third, the maintenance of\nsuch standardization of entry that the user of the index\nwill find the references to material he is seeking actu~\nally brought together in the index in appropriate units\nand not dispersed (the material on Oil should all be\nunder \"Petroleum\" or \"Oil\" but not split between the\ntwo headings.)\n\nIn deciding on the scope of the index, the most\nextreme comprehensiveness would include everything that\nhas been printed -- advertising, news and editorials. A\nmore restricted scope would include only news and edi~\ntorials; a still more restricted scope would be limited\nto news about local or regional events, and editorial\nexpressions of opinions; a still more restricted scope\nwould limit the index to news about local events and\nopinion about local events. Even within the narrowest\nof these areas further exclusions are possible. Various\ndecisions are possible in respect of treatment of fea~\nture material and regularly recurring parts of the news~\npaper, such as the market page. But the main require~\nment of a sound indexing technique is that there be a\nclear cut distinction made between that which is included\nand that which is excluded, and that this be understood\nall along the line by all the workers who make the\nindex and that it be notified in some way to the users\nof the index.\n\nWhen the decision has been reached as to what\nparticular items in the newspaper are to be subject\nto the indexing procedure, there still remains open\na problem of defining the intensity of indexing of each\nseparate article. This issue comes up practically in\ndealing with proper names. If a news story mentions\na dozen names of men and the names of two or three\n\ncorporations, what principles of selection are to obtain?\nUnless these are clearly stated and understood alike by\nworker and user, the user of the index will never know\nwhether on the one hand he may rely on the indexers'\nsearching or on the other hand, he must search the whole\nfile anew for himself. In meeting this problem one\nextreme, followed at Savannah, is to take every proper\nname. In covering early American newspaper files which\nare small this scheme is practical, but it would break\ndown in the bulky modern file. Another method of making\nthe elimination is to ask the question in respect of\nevery account of an event: \"Who did what to whom?\"\nand the story, reduced to its skeleton form, will often\nbring out the essential proper names and exclude the\nnon-essentials. In general this has been one of the \nweakest spots in relief labor indexing, and more experi~\nence is needed to find the right answer.\n\nAccuracy is of two kinds: the first is the mechani~\ncal accuracy of making correct date, page and column\nreferences; the second, is more difficult. A story of\n1000 words length is to be reduced to an essential seven\nor eight words which will tell the user of the index\nwhether he ought to look at the original item. If these\nfew words touch on an inconsequential part of the story\nand avoid the more significant part, the entry is sub~\nstantially and for purposes of use inaccurate. It would\nbe much simpler to work out a routine for this kind of \naccuracy if it were possible to mark and destroy files\nduring the indexing operation. That possibility being\nexcluded, two methods have been evolved. One of them\nsets an indexer to work to make as many index entries\nas there seem to be main points in the story; this man\nis then followed up by another who checks the judgment\nof the first with this own judgment. A second method\ndivides the labor differently. This is used in a Texas\nproject. The worker answers in respect of a story the\njournalist's basic questions, -- \"who, where, when, what,\nwhy\" -- in briefest possible space. This summarization\nis then checked for accuracy, and the indexing operation\nwhich breaks it down into appropriate index entries,\nNew York Times Index style, is done at the next level\nof operations. This act of compression tends to squeeze\nout automatitcally the non-essential proper names. In\nall cases the first stage in a newspaper indexing opera~\ntion transfers from the newspaper page to separate slips\nof paper highly compressed information which must then\nbe run through a checking operation to control its ac~\ncuracy.\n\nThe next problem to be solved is the standardization\nof entry and arrangement. There would be three conceivable\narrangements for the references controlling the content of\na newspaper file: chronological, logical, and alphabetical.\nThe first is often used in controlling manuscript material\n(the calendar); the second is the arrangement corresponding\nto the table of contents of a book and is exemplified in\na thesaurus or in a shelf list of a library; the third is\nexemplified in the dictionary or a library's dictionary\ncatalogue. By an index we mean the latter type of arrange~\nment.\n\nAn alphabetical arrangement depends necessarily\nupon the choice of words governing the alphabetical\narrangement, and the words to be chosen fall into two\nclasses for indexing purposes. The first class and the\nmost easily arranged is that of proper names, the names\nof individual people, of places, of buildings, of corpora~\ntions. No subjective element of decision need enter into\nthe alphabetical form of a proper name. The rules for\ncorporate names can be made and enforced. An index\nwould be very useful even if it consisted solely of proper\nname entries alphabetioally arranged, and followed by a\nfew words expanding the index entry. Book indexes are\nfrequently made in that way. The more difficult problem\narises in what are called subject entries, where a com~\nmon noun must stand in its alphabetical place as a finding\npoint for a number of entries. How is that common noun\nto be chosen? If it is left to the judgment of a large\nnumber of independent workers to choose the common noun\nwhich will stand as the subject entry for each of their\nstories, the index will have relatively low value because\nthe user may not be able to guess the word that occurred\nto the mind of the indexer. In the choice of these words,\nthe rules and policies adopted in index-making vary in\ntwo ways; the first variation is between rigidity and\nsubjective judgment. If the list of subject words is\nunduly rigid, some of them will prove inappropriate;\nif the list is made unduly elastio, the user will have\nto guess his way through the index. The second varia~\ntion occurs in distinguishing between the more general\nand the more specific type of subject entry. If the\nprinciple of using the general words is carried to an\nextreme, the arrangement becomes more and more logical\nrather than alphabetical; if the principle of specific\nwords is carried to an extreme, the index will not actu~\nally bring together the things that ought to stand together.\nIn both cases a right line must be taken between the\ntwo extremes, and the one supreme virtue is consistency.\n\nDefiniteness in scope, accuracy in transcription, consis~\ntency in the treatment of headings -- these are the virtues\nof an index, and particularly of a newspaper index. \n\nThe most important model for newspaper indexing is,\nof course, the New York Times Index. There is however\nanother principle of arrangement followed in the control\nof scientific literature which may bprove to have its place\nin control of the content of newspapers. In Chemical\nAbstracts and Biological Abstracts the journal literature\nin those sciences is abstracted; the abstracts are arranged\nand indexed. A person consulting the control may turn\nfirst to the index, and there make his first selection as\nto what he wishes to consult; from the index he may move\nto the abstract, where he can make a second selection,\nfor the abstract tells him enough about the original\narticle so that he knows whether it will be worth his\ntime to procure it for consultation. The application of\nthis principle to newspaper work was suggested by Solon\nJ. Buck, director of publications of the National Archives,\nand an experiment with it was made in a Cleveland W.P.A.project.\n\nIn the arrangement of the index items there is another\nvital decision to be made, namely the period of cumulation.\nAn index cumulated annually has certain points of conveni~\nence as against an index of longer cumulation for those\nusers who recognize their problems as falling within a\ngiven year. An index of longer cumulation has other values.\nInconsistencies in topical arrangement will give rise to\ngreater inconvenience in a long cumulation than in a short\none for it is more difficult in the long cumulation to\nconsult a large number of topical entries. There are many\nuses of the index, however, which involve the tracing of\na particular name over a long period of time. If, as in\nthe case of a proper name, there is no possible variation\nin form of entry, the long-term cumulation shows up its\nsuperiorities.\n\nII.\n\nWhen the decision has been made as to what kind of\nindex is desired, the problem of using WPA labor as a\nmeans of making it becomes one of engineering and office\nmanagement. If it happened that newspaper indexing were\na long-established profession in the country and that there\nwere a large number of unemployed newspaper indexers the\napproach made to this problem would be very different\nfrom that which is now necessary. The key to success in\nthe use of relief labor is the rigorous definition and\n\n\ncoordination of a series of tasks in factory style, and\nthese tasks must be so planned that they are within the\ncompetence of the workers actually available. The organi~\nzation of relief labor permits of certain specific clas~\nsifications of relief workers. These must be understood\nby anyone planning a project in a practical way. The rules\ngoverning labor classification allow of no more than four\ngrades, from junior clerk to professional worker. The\nnumber of supervisory positions at higher rates of pay\nthan the professional workers can receive is strictly\nlimited. In the planning of work the balance of duties\nmust be so arranged that as much as possible is done by\nworkers in the junior classifications. To ignore this\nprinciple in planning a newspaper indexing job will result\nin the accumulation of a great amount of unworked and\nunedited slips, products of the first operation. The\nsupply of workers sufficiently skilled to put the finishing\ntouches on an index may be found so meagre that their\nworking hours must be conserved to the utmost and as\nmuch as possible of the work mechanized and routinized.\nIt will be found that within the limits of clearly\nspecified tasks training can be rapid and effective and\nhigh efficiencies quickly produced. The efficiencies\nin the main correspond to those of the manual workers\nwho tighten bolts on an assembly line, not to those of\nthe master craftsman who can take responsibility for the\nwhole product.\n\nThose who undertake to do newspaper indexing with\nWPA labor without a clear realization of what these\nfacts mean in practice will be found constantly to cry\nout for more and better supervisors when their need is\nfor more and better analysis of the job.\n\nAn indexing project will prove to be a growing\nthing. One kind of procedure will break down in prac~\ntice, another be substituted for it. Not only will\nindividual training occur on the job, but the organiza~\ntion as a whole will gain in experience. To make this\ngain as rapid as possible it is desirable to push some\nof the indexing work through all its stages to finished\nform as quickly as possible so that the weaknesses and\nstrengths of the organization show up quickly, and the\nqulaity of the finished product can be judged before\ntoo great an investment has been made in what may prove\nto be inappropriate routines.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "\n\nMEMORANDUM ON MICROPHOTOGRAPHY\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nMicrophotography is not an end in itself but a means to\nan end; ample library resources are not ends in themselves\nbut means to an end; the same is true of the free flow of do~\ncumentation. The end that all these things have as their com~\nmon object is that scholars may read what they went to read\nwhen they want to read it, and may communicate to each other\nwhat they want to write when they choose to write it.\n\nJust where does microphotography fit into this picture?\nIt is one of a number of mechanical techniques supplementary\nto printing (including non\u2014edition, full-size publication by\nblueprint, photostat, Ozalid, etc.; large edition microprint;\nand small edition near-print). The essential problem is to\nfit all the techniques together in the larger pattern.\n\nIn this larger pattern microphotography has three kinds\nof use: (1) To increase the efficiency with which individual\nscholars collect their own material; (2) To increase the ef~\nficiency with which libraries and other institutions concerned\nwith documentation provide scholars with documents; and (3)\nTo reduce the cost incurred in communicating the results of\nscholarly labor among scholars. In the development of the first\nfunction (individual scholars' use), attention should be given\nto the minimum training necessary for the scholar to use the\ncamera just as he uses the typewriter. The second use (insti~\ntutional function) can be divided into (a) preservation of\nmaterial otherwise subject to destruction because of imperman~\nonce of paper or lack of storage space, (b) rational collec~\ntion of material free from the capricious effects of market\naccidents, and (c) complete mobility of material by selling\nfilm copies instead of lending books in some cases, and by the\nlending of the film itself in other cases. Preservation is\nmost clearly at issue in the case of American newspaper files\nand business archives. The rational collecting of material\nis a problem that is most comprehensively framed as the prob~\nlem of making and filling a national want list of materials\nfor research from all over the world. The motility of material\nturns at present on the maintenance of film services for short-\nrun copying at minimal costs, the development of film lending\npractices for long-run copies, and the careful watching of the\ncopyright law and of relation of practice to the copyright law.\n\nWithin this larger pattern there are two other elements\nnot strictly mechanical: the union catalogue or finding list\nby which a searcher[?] can quickly locate the document he wants\nwhen he wants it; and the bibliography by which the scho~\nlar can discover the answers to the questions which determine\nthe use of his time -- what he shall read and what he shall not\nread. The mechanical techniques and the locational catalogues\nand bibliographies should be systematically inter-related.\n\nMicrophotography is then a part of a field of mechanical\ntechniques which is in turn a part of a wider field of tech~\nniques for rendering documents accessible to scholars, and in\nall three of the uses outlined above distinction must be made\nbetween developments that can be expected to take care of them~\nselves and developments that ought to be guided, stimulated,\nor headed off.\n\nII. COLLECTION OF MATERIAL BY THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOLAR:\n\nJust as the last generation of scholars learned to take\nportable typewriters into the libraries, so the next generation\nof scholars will probably take portable cameras. It is evident\nthat we know very little about what this portable camera will\nbe. The questions of roll or sheet microfilm and of reduction\nratio are unsolved. Their solution is related to the question\nof how much training a scholar requires in order to do useful\nphotographing at a low or high reduction ratio. Again, the\nphotographic technique must lend itself to suitable filing.\nProbably no organization working in this field has adequately\ntaken into account the difference between the individual scholar\nproblem and the problem of institutional and professional use\nfor scholars. In the case of the individual scholar, low cost\napparatus -- both for photographing and for reading -- is more\nimportant than in the case of the institution. The cost situ~\nation is entirely different because the scholar does his own\nselecting of material to be copied and costs are principally\nlimited to materials and processing. The reduction ratio prob~\nlem is different because the amount of reduction ratio that is\nfeasible is probably limited more by the training and skill\nof the scholar than the character of the apparatus or the\nquality of the photographic surface. So it would seem that the\nfirst thing we need is a better idea of the amount of photogra~\nphic skill on the part of the individual scholar that ought\nto be taken for granted in the development of apparatus and\npractices and the process of training necessary to impart this\nskill in minimum time. Keyed to this level of skill the cheap~\nest possible scholar's camera should be designed. The Photo~\nrecord is too elaborate and expensive; the Leica, Argus, Kodak\nRetina[?], etc. are adaptations. Possibily a miniature Photostat\nwould be better than a film unit.\n\nIII. IMPROVEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL SERVICES:\n\n1. Technical and cost studies:\n\nBecause institutions can invest in more expensive equip~\nment than individual scholars and can hire professional person~\nnel, they need more refined technical standards than the indi~\nvidual scholar, and the planning and pricing of their services\nrequire more genuine cost information than we now possess.\nThree studies are necessary:\n\n(a) The completion of the work that has been promoted at\nthe Bureau of Standards under the direction of the Advisory\nCommittee to the BS on the Reproduction of Records. The need\nfor this work of quality standardization is emphasized in Ben~\nnett's report on sheet microfilm. Micro-copying needs its units\nof measurement -- its \"micropoints\" -- to measure letter sizes\nand some suitable units to measure the different characteris~\ntics of faithful and legible reproduction. When such fundamen~\ntal work is accomplished it will be easier to compare techniques\nand materials (film, paper, diazo, microprint, etc.) and to plan\nprojects and estimate mechanical costs. In the meantime one\nof the dangers in the field is premature standardization on\na certain medium or of reduction ratio.\n\n(a) The second cost study has been requested several times\nof ADI but has never really been done. It is a careful time\nand motion accounting of the costs of microphotography under\nlibrary conditions covering all types of work -- from short-run\narticles from scientific periodicals to long-run, high-reduc~\ntion ratio jobs. These cost studies should be so carefully\ndone that it will be possible to compute costs based on full\nutilization of man-power and equipment and to use the data in\nestablishing sound rate structures.\n\n(c) The third type of study is one for which we are not\nyet ready but that will become necessary as the meaning of an\ninter-library system becomes more clear to the librarians of\nthe country. This is a study of costs of library service which\nwould include the cost of the unused book as a part of the cost\nof providing the reader with the book he uses. Library collec~\ntiona above a certain magnitude include an increasing propor~\ntion of books that are not consulted but which properly belong\nin the library because it is impossible to predict whether they\nwill be consulted or not. On the basis of this study librarians\nmight discover more effective ways of leaning upon each other\nfor the book contingently needed. To illustrate: What would\nbe the value to Widner Library of a catalogue of the New York\nPublic Library or of a union catalogue of all the libraries in\nthe country? If Widner Library were to regard these other li~\nbrary holdings as contingently a part of its own collection\nwith each item capable of being summoned for use when desired,\nthe value of these catalogues would be infinitely greater than\nif the library would regard them merely as a source of bib~\nliographical information.\n\nIf these studies should prove that there are classes of\nbooks whose cost per use is 10, 20, or 100 times the cost of\nacquisition and administration, then library accounting would\ncome increasingly to rely on the inter-library system for this\ntype of book. It has been a great misfortune that the prob~\nlem of inter-library relations has been so frequently stated\nas if its essence were a matter of good will or cooperative\nspirit or ethiCs. That which is needed is an analysis of li~\nbrary functions and costs which will point to the line that\ndistinguishes the responsibilities of separate libraries from\nthe responsibilities of the library system of the country.\nA preliminary study of this type ought to be made of the use\nof newspaper files, particularly of American newspaper files,\nbecause it is impossible for any library to have them all and\nit is probable that inter-library lending of film copies of\nnewspaper files will have a large place in library administra~\ntion. These studies may result in a diversion of library in~\ncome so that libraries will spend less in purchasing the little-\nused materials that are already available in other libraries\nand more in bringing copies of books actually needed to their\nusers when the books are needed. Such a diversion of library\nincome would tend, first, to render the national book resources\nof the country more comprehensive, and, second to increase the\nproportion of library money spent for photo-duplication on\nrequest.\n\n2. Preservation:\n\nOne large function of film copying is the preservation\nof materials that otherwise must be lost either because they\nare printed on inpermanent paper (newspapers) or because stor~\nage space is inadequate to keep them in their original form\n(business archives). The investment necessary to preserve\nAmericen newspaper files far exceeds anything that can reason~\nably be expected from Foundation grants or even the expenditures\nof the larger American libraries. Particularly futile would\nbe any venture which made an effort to save these American news~\npaper file by filming than with the expectation of recouping\ncosts of filming from sales of the film cepies to libraries.\nProbably the only source of income adequate to save these news~\npaper files will have to come from the localities involved,\nthrough their own library agencies or their newspapers. It\ncould be much in the national interest if the practice of lend~\ning film copies of these files could be established. This applies\nparticularly to the bulkly files of the late 19th and early\n20th centuries. A grant from Rockefeller Foundation was given\nto ADI to do a sample job in Ohio, where a WPA project to film\nand index newspapers was under way. The use of this money has\ncome up to expectation insofar as it is actually furnishing a\n\nlending copy of the film, to be administered through the Ohio\nState Archaeological and Historical Society, but it has been\ndisappointing that the ADI did not succeed in using the grant\nto discover ways of stimulating local interest in the preser~\nvation of local files.\n\nIt will lead to mistakes of policy if the function of\npreserving what otherwise will disintegrate or be destroyed\nis confused with the function of rounding out rational collec~\ntions of materials. Where preservation is the object, the num~\nber of film copies made should be very few since the cost of\nmaking extra film copies diverts resources from the preservation\nof other items; where the rounding out of collections is the\nobject, the number of copies to be made depends entirely upon\nthe specific case.\n\n3. Making of Rational Collections:\n\nMicro\u2014copying permits libraries to round out their col~\nlections regardless of the accident of the market, and to do\nthis at moderate cost. No book need be regarded as out of print.\nThe very magnitude of this opportunity points to its dangers\nand difficulties and raises the question already touched upon\nof how far our library system is to be regarded as a national\nunit and how far each library is to be on its own. Conceiving\nthe library system of the country as a national unit, a unit\nwhich spends over two milliOn dollars a year to import books\nfrom abroad, it is not unreasonable to plan for the day when a\ncopy, photographic or otherwise, of every worthwhile book in\nthe world will be housed in some American library. Meanwhile\nthere are many cases where due to the accident of the market\nfundamental reference sets that ought to be available in a num~\nber of libraries are actually available in very few. To round\nout the total national resources of the country by using micro-\nphotography requires a national want list and a union catalogue,\nand these must come. They are as much a part of the new picture\npresented by the new techniques as are the cameras and reading\nmachines themselves. In the expansion of our national resources\nof books, it would probably be wise to work for the minimum\nnumber of copies, as in the case of American newspapers.\n\nThere are cases, however, in which n number of libraries\nseems to have the same need for some fundamental body of mater~\nial, and the question arises whether in those cases filming\nprojects should be sponsored in the expectations that the costs\nof filming will be returned from sale of the film copies.\nWithout deciding on any particular case the following principles\nseem to apply:\n\n(a) Wherever a body of consumers is willing to pledge in\nadvance the funds necessary for a micro-copying project with\ncosts pro-rated among the subscribers, the job should be done,\nthough in many cases private capital will do the work.\n\n(b) If the costs of manufacturing the negative film are\npredictable with reasonable accuracy and the quality of the film\ncan be described in suitable units of measurement advance sub~\nscriptions including the pro-rating of the costs of the negative\nshould be obtained before the film is made, and no subsidy\nshould be necessary unless as a simple revolving fund which could\nbe guaranteed not to be dissipated. There is no reason for\nintroducing into filming projects the type of risk-taking sub~\nsidy which has marked publication investment in the past.\n\n        Foundation activity in providing large sets of materials for\n      \n\n        a number of institutions should be aimed at helping the consum~\n      \n\n        ers to organize to supply their needs, not at the subsidizing\n      \n\n        of producers who will promote their wares among the consumers.\nAbove all we should not be misled at this point by the concep~\ntion that there is any special merit in the shear quantity of\nmicrofilm produced. The quantities will take care of themselves\nwhen the right equivalent is established in the functioning of\nour libraries. This should remind us that if we are to look\nforward to the lending of long runs of film we ought not to cre~\nate unnecessary purchaser interests which would militate against\nthe development of lending.\n\n4. Motility of Materials:\n\nThe most important improvement in library services will\narise from the tremendously increased motility of all materials\nfor research. This development in a sense includes all the\nothers. It has already been touched upon in connection with\nthe need for film lending and with the possibility of drawing\nfrom abroad books not in America, and the need for an analysis\nof costs to libraries of maintaining unused or little-used books\non their shelves. Full motility of materials is a pre-condi~\ntion of the development of a national library system: it pre~\nsupposes a union catalogue in book form available in every li~\nbrary. Even our bibliographical techniques may have to be modi~\nfied.\n\nThe full mobility of materials is at the present moment\nmost nearly realised in the case of that literature which al~\nready has its union catalogue in book form and its special type\nof bibliography, and this the literature of the natural sciences.\nLocations of natural science periodicals are known in any library\nin the country from the union list of periodicals, and the\nbibliographical control of the articles in these periodicals\nthrough Chemical and Biological Abstracts is far more complete\n\nand comprehensive than is normal in the social science or hu~\nmanities. For this reason it was to be expectod that the na~\ntural scientists would be first to appreciate the full meaning\nof the motility of material and first to run into some of the\ndifficulties in realizing the potentialities of microfilm.\nAs fast as library resources pertinent to othar fields are union\ncatalogued nnd bibliographies in other fields are brought to\nthe level of current scientific bibliography, the problems and\nopportunities confronting the natural sciences will spread to\nthe other fields. And this will come to an issue in the option\nbetween current purchase of material on paper and reliance upon\nfilming if and when a copy is needed.\n\nAt this point is becomes necessary to work out very care~\nfully the relation of film copying practices to literary pro~\nperty and the copyright law. Probably everything that can be\ndone is being done to keep this situation in hand -- there is\nthe gentlemen's agreement of 1935, the able legal assistance\nof Mr. Manning of the firm of Root, Clark, Buckner and Ballan~\ntine, the participation in the sessions on the revision of the\ncopyright law; and yet we may have fumbled a little psycholo~\ngically in promoting film copying of complete journal files\nwithout adequate realization of the psychological consequences\nand of the bearing the enterprise might have on the special re~\nlations of American libraries with certain German publishing\nfirms. There may be something in the project of Mathematical\nAbstracts to cause a similar concern, but in this case it might\nbe possible to work out an example of using film to expand the\nrange of learned journals.\n\nAnother problem connected with the motility of material\nis the number and location of first-class film photographic\nunits and the cost levels at which they operate. We cannot\nexpect to have a high efficiency filming unit in every library;\non the other hand if we have a really national library system\nour union catalogue will note unique holdings of every library\nwhether it happens to be a film center or not, and in such cases\nnothing is simpler than to combine lending and filming. Let\na small library near Chicago send its book to Chicago to be filmed\nand let the film be sent to tho purchaser. This would mean\nthat there would be film installations within over-night mail\nof every place in the country and there location is again re~\nlated to the problem of union cataloguing because we still do\nnot know whether we want to have regional union catalogues or\nnot.\n\nIV. REDUCTION OF COSTS OF COMMUNICATION:\n\nThe third major role of microfilm is to reduce the cost\nof communicating the results of scholarly labor among scholars.\nIf every book and manuscript in a library is available to an\n\n\u2018 i f s 4 oe\n\u2019 ay Fe oO a\nptghey we a \u2018oy \u00bb ee\n, ak oe af Hes a ogy Fe hey ok Poa\nseep Pe vo\n/ - , 4 vier\n? \u00e9 wet \u2018 ety \u201d\n\u2019 foe * be, fF ms Fe tm\n+ \u2018 f- , 0\nae y \u00a5 of wh og\n\na . tr\nrf\naghast Of f SO8 wa Pt\n\n\u2019 . foe te + hip\nf- . ob fe fi. fone neem\nHoe Hy , 7 , 4 sa wn\n\u2018 s ' f for ee wre\nf \u201c fo: . pone\n. af \u201cfy \u2019 / tee ae\n. \u00e9 ete? \u2019 : * f : oe \u2019 te etite\n} \u00a2 a \u2019 foe a ole\n\u00e9  , ge \u2019 t \u2019 t tte ge A tee\n. e y \u2018 , \u00a2 oo %\no- 4 of Soy gee\n, .!

    "text": "\n\nMemorandum on Present Status of Joint Committee Affairs\n\nApril 23, 1940\n\nI. Business Records:\n\nThe new edition of the pamphlet on preservation of business\nrecords will be issued by the Business Historical Society of Har~\nvard University. It will be prepared under the general guidance of\nProfessor Gras of the Joint Committee, and with the support of a\ngrant of $400 from the S.S.R.C.\n\nIn Cleveland the University is continuing to collect business\nrecords and use them in the local history seminar.\n\nThis category of materials is still being approached in a\nhaphazard manner, but it is to be hoped that a definite effort will\nbe made to tie it in with the more comprehensive program for non-\nprofessional scholarship which is being developed in Cleveland and\nmay then be transplanted elsewhere (see VII below).\n\nII. Copyright:\n\nThe new copyright bill, S.3043, was introduced in the Senate\non January 8, 1940, and referred to the Committee an Patents. On\nApril 2, a letter, drafted by Mr. Lydenberg of the Joint Committee\nand Mr. Manning of the law firm of Root, Clark, Buckner & Ballantine,\nwas sent to the members of the Senate Committee on Patents and to\nSenators Pittman and Thomas. This letter outlined the nature of the\ninterest of research workers in copyright, the position of the Joint\nCommittee with respect to the bill, and requested the opportunity of\nbeing heard at any hearings to be held on the bill. On April 3, a\nletter was sent by the chairman of the Committee on Patents to Dr.\nBinkley, stating that the committee had decided to take no action on\nthe bill at this session of Congress as the time was too short \"to\nhold the necessary hearings and to give the bill the thorough study\nsuch a measure requires....\"\n\nOne question to be decided is whether a new gentleman's agree~\nment should be drawn up to supersede that of 1935.\n\nIn the meantime, sound and generally recognized practices of\ncopying for research purposes should continue to be developed.\n\nIII. Category of Newspapers:\n\nThree main problems to be considered in the treatment of\nnewspapers are:\n\n(a) How to treat the cross section of public opinion as\nrepresented in supplementary newspaper files which have not been\nindexed (the index usually being confined to the main file of a\nperiod).\n\nIn a session with Mr. Chapman of the Washington WPA on\nthis, Miss Barry was told that if a manual of procedure could be\nworked up for the Washington Project Control Division, the Division\ncould see that it was utilized by the newspaper projects being\noperated in the country. In the matter of getting advice on pro~\ncedure, Dr, Binkley had been working through the committee on\nnewspapers (of which he was Chairman) of the American Historical\nAssociation committee on historical source materials. This con~\nnection should be maintained, and possibly a somewhat larger group\ndrawn in. Miss Barry will see Mr. Kellar, chairman of the AHA\nCommittee, on this next month.\n\nContact has been maintained with the researchers inter~\nested in the original newspaper digest procedure, and this should\nprove useful at this stage. In the meantime, Professor Cole of the\nUniversity here, who has specialized in the use of newspaper mater~\nials, is helping with the immediate problems of procedure for the\npioneer project on the ground.\n\n(b) How to promote the filming of newspaper files in connec~\ntion with their indexing, and how to establish the practice of making\ntwo positive film copies of the indexed file -- one to replace in\nservice the newspaper files on the ground, the other to be made\navailable on interlibrary loan.\n\nA set of rules elaborating on this procedure was drawn\nup for the Washington WPA but has not yet been put into very effec~\ntive operation. An attempt should be made to check on this delay.\n\nAt the annual meeting of the American Library Association\nin Cincinnati next month, there will be an exhibit on newspaper\nmicro-filming and indexing. In connection with this exhibit the em~\nphasis will be laid on filming and making two positives (which amount\nto only about 4% of the total cost of an indexing-filming project).\n\nThe American Historical Association is planning to have\na session on \"new aids to research\" at the annual meeting in New York\nnext December. At this meeting the problem not only of newspaper\n\ntreatment, but the much larger picture of the role microphotography\ncan play in the preservation of research materials in the present\nworld situation might well be brought into focus.\n\n(c) How to stimulate the transplanting of the Annals of\n      \n\n        Cleveland idea to other communities. This is one of those slow\ntasks where much patience and perseverance are required. A favor~\nable attitude had just been created in Baltimore and should be fol~\nlowed up before it lapses. Interest which had been aroused in\nother communities should be kept alive by correspondence and encour~\nagement.\n\nIV. Use of WPA White-Collar Workers Generally:\n\nThis is largely a matter of organizing campaigns and provid~\ning stimulus and encouragement in the form of comprehensive and con~\ncrete programs to be worked up in the various communities. At the\nnational Open House Week of WPA, to be held sometime next month,\nDr. Binkley's article on \"The Cultural Program of the WPA\" will be\ngiven wide distribution and used as the basis for promoting the use\nof white-collar labor.\n\nV. Copy-to-Order Method of Publication:\n\nExperimentation in the use of the copy-to-order method of\npublication is going forward, and a start has been made on time\nand motion studies. There is a good deal to be done here which\nshould be worthwhile because of the tie-up it will have with non-\nprofessional scholarship. When the cost and utility curves have\nbeen plotted, this method may prove to have a significant place in\nresearch. In the meantime, the link between microphotography and\nB-W should be investigated. If it is possible and practical, as it\nmay well be, to use a positive print enlargement, made on a thin\ninsurance bromide paper from a negative film, as a master sheet\nfor B-W copies, the handicap of being able to use only materials\nprinted or typed on one side of the page can be eliminated, and\nthe step of transparentizing material printed on heavy paper can be\nomitted. The problem of the long roll versus the individual sheets,\nor of the double sheet folded with the blank side in, must be con~\nsidered in terms of curling, collating, folding and binding. The\nproblem of permanency is not yet solved.\n\nAs it is developing now, this method should have a place\nsomewhere between microphotography, carbon copying, and hectograph.\n\nVI. Non-Professional Translation of Latin-American Literature:\n\n\nThis project, which envisages the use of non-professional\npersonnel with some leisure time and an interest in and knowledge\nof the Spanish language to do volunteer translating which would\nbe published in a non-edition method of publication, has had a\nnice start but requires supervision. Se\u00f1or Samper-Ortega of the\nColombian Embassy has been very generous in cooperation, has\nsecured permission for translation of some forty of the 100-volume\nset of literature of which he is editor, and has made available to\nthe Joint Committee a set of volumes to be cut into sections and\ndistributed for translation. It would be desirable to secure similar\ncooperation with some of the other Latin Anerican countries.\n\nThe assistance of the Department of Romance Languages of\nthe University here has been nade available, and an informal com~\nmittee on translation has been established, of which Miss Barry is\nchairman, to make contacts, maintain correspondence, act as editors,\nand arrange for availability of the translations.\n\nSome strategic planning needs to be put under way to channel\nthis type of activity into its proper place in the whole schema of\nauxiliary research.\n\nVII. Leisure-Time Pursuit of Scholarship and Letters:\n\nA grant of $10,000 has been made available by the Carnegie\nCorporation to Western Reserve University to support the Cleveland\nProgram for the Leisure-time Pursuit of Scholarship and Letters.\nThis program was largely planned by Dr. Binkley along the Joint Com~\nmittee lines of use of the non-professional scholar in research, and\nuse of the non-commercial techniques of reproduction of materials in\ndistribution. Miss Barry is one of a committee of three appointed\nby the president of the University to consider this program.\n\nAs the name implies, it is a plan envisaged to promote in\nthis commmity non-professional creative activities in research and\n\n        belles lettres. The first step, an exploratory stage, embraces a\ncensus of actual and potential labor supply and of the kinds of\nstimulus and training to which they would respond; and a survey of\nthe problems in research and the uses of materials for research\ncapable of solution by this personnel. The second step, an ex~\nperimental stage, would probably take the form of an \"institute\" at\nthe University whose organization would be largely determined by\nthe facts uncovered in the census and survey.\n\nIn this connection, indeed as an inherent part of the plan,\nthe study of local archives should be considered. Local archives\nform a category of materials whose use may be stimulated and studied\nby the local interest aroused by this program. It is hoped that\nthough Mr. Posner thay be no longer available to conduct this study,\n\nthe grant of $1800 given by the Carnegie Corporation for this\npurpose may be used to employ another person as well qualified\nas possible to carry on this work. This is definitely an op~\nportunity to put into practice some of the ideas of the Joint\nCommittee.\n\nVIII. Correspondence and General Office Maintenance:\n\nGeneral correspondence of the office is being maintained\nby Miss Barry. Letters requiring technical information are being\nchannelled to the appropriate persons in the \"network\" that has\nevolved through the years. Some policy will have to be worked\nout for those letters requiring special strategy and long-range\nplanning.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nAdeline Barry\nExecutive Secretary\n\n"

    "text": "\n\n4 November, 1933\n\nTo the Members of the\nJoint Committee and Correspondent:\n\nThree large-scale enterprises (relating to library resour~\nces, adult education and unemployment relief), which, consid~\nered separately, are visionary and impracticable, but combined\ntogether may become practicable and imperative, for they present an\nopportunity that may never recur for enriching American life at\nan important intellectual level.\n\nThese three enterprise: are, briefly:\n\n1. The improvement of American resources in materials for re~\nsearch by taking comprehensive inventories and calendars of\nmanuscript and other collections. These inventories would be\nmade throughout the country and deposited in the Library of\nCongress, constituting a national catalogue of a great body of\ntreasures which are at present in many cases unorganized and \nuseless, even to the institution possessing them.\n\n2. The development of the practice of reporting unpublished\nmaterials to the Library of Congress in such a way that a\nlarger proportion of the population may become permanently\nuseful participators in the activities of scholarship. Incen~\ntive, status and leadership will be given to the tasks of col~\nlecting and organizing materials for research.\n\n3. The relief of that class of unemployed who have started on\na career of scholarship, but have been sidetracked by the de~\npression. It is wasteful to permit the demoralization of these\npeople. They could be saved and used just as efficiently in\nimproving our cultural materials as the C.C.C. is improving\nour forest resources.\n\nIs there not a possibility of combining these three enter~\nprises on the following basis:\n\n1) Relief funds at subsistence wages from the Federal\nGovernment; product of work to become property of the Library\nof Congress.\n\n2) Recruitment through institutions active in scholar~\nship.\n\n3) Definitions of tasks and detailed administration\nthrough libraries, historical societies, etc. on volunteer\nbasil. \n\n4) General administration and technical standardization\nfinanced by a foundation, with aid of volunteer advisers.\n\nAt the present moment the question confronting us is this:\nDoes this project possess sufficient possible merit to\ntaking steps to give it, immediately, some further definition?\n\nOn behalf or the Joint Committee on Materials for Research\nI can testify to the vastness and importance of the tasks of\ninventory and calendar work, the desirability of developing\nwithin the world of scholarship other activities than those of\nwriting and publishing monographs, and the key position of a\nstanding national inventory of research material resources in\nthe development of plans for the future of research in this\ncountry.\n\nI do not know how large is the class of people who could\nand would do this work at subsistence wages if called upon,\nnor how the administrative costs would figure, nor how the plan\nwould fit the policies of the National Administration, but it\nshould be possible to clear up these points with the help of\ncompetent advisers. The plan is not ripe for action, but is\nready for the next step in definition and formulation. Shall\nthat step be taken?\n\nOr shall we take upon ourselves the responsibility for\ndropping the whole thing at this stage?\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nRCB\n\nRCB/FT\n\nThis is a postscript to the enclosed letter. The following\nnote, just received from Robert T. Crane of the Social Science\nResearch Council, is of interest:\n\n\"On my last trip to Washington I found that the education\npeople had about abandoned hope of getting relief funds into\neducation. They sre suggesting a small federal appropriation,\nsome five hundred millions annually, for educational relief\nthat would go directly into the schools. These special schemes\nseem generally to have struck a snag, though the proposal to\nsend the unemployed to college has not been given the coup de\ngrace as yet. I can see no room to hope for effecting the plans\nyou have had tentatively in mind.\"\n\nYou will doubtless wish to take this opinion into account\nin forming en opinion on the whole subject. The question is\nreally, at this moment, how far ought we to go in defining a\nplan before deciding to drop it or present it.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCopy to\nLeland\nCrane\nLydenberg\nCartwright\nJudd\nTyler\nDavid\nMarshall\nColeman\nQuinn\nBuck\nGras\nMurdock\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "\n\nMEMORANDUM ON A UNION CATALOG OF THE PHILADELPHIA\nLIBRARIES\n\nNew developments in photographic equipment undertaken by the\nEastman Kodak Company and its subsidiary, the Recordak Corporation\npresent possibilities in the formation of of a union catalog which\ndeserve serious consideration. By the use of this equipment, a\nfilm copy can be made of the library cards of the various libraries\nto be included in the union catalog. This film copy, which would\ntemporarily fulfill the functions of a union cataLog, could be\nused for reproducing positive prints for a card union catalog.\n\nMaking Film Copies:\n\nFiln copies of library card catalogs, in alphabetical order,\ncould be made by means of the Recordak machine, produced by the\nRecordak Corporation, 350 Madison Avenue, New York City. The\ncards, removed from the cabinets and replaced in them by a helper,\ncould be fed into this machine by cheap labor, with a little\npractice, at an average rate of 80 to 100 per minute. I am cer~\ntain feeding into a Recordak can be done considerably faster than\ninto a Dexigraph. I used the Recordak for reproducing the trans~\ncripts of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration code hearings.\nA total of 136,000 pages of transcripts, size 8\u00bd x 11 inches, mostly\nin thin onion-skin paper, and including a large amount of bound\npamphlet material and other material difficult to handle, was run\nthrough in twelve days.\n\nThe Recordak machine advisable for library cards would be one\nreproducing in 16 to 1 diameters. When film copies produced by\nmachine are read by means of a reading device, developed by\nthe Recordak Corporation, an image one and one half times the size\nof the original is projected onto a plate. In my opinion this\nprojection is more legible than the original. A sample run of\nfilm thus produced is in my possession and is available for exhibit.\n\nA film having an acetate base, aand hence, it is believed,\npermanent and non\u2014inflammable, which is 16 mm. width, is used. The\ncost of this film, including its development, is $5.50 per 200\nfeet. A two hundred foot roll of film will reproduce 10,700\ncards, or approximately 20 cards for 1\u00a2.\n\nExclusive of film cost is the machine rental, which is $30.00\nper month, plus the cost of moving the machine from library to\nlibrary. Labor costs would be slight.\n\nIf the union catalog of the libraries of the Philadelphia\narea included the University of Pennsylvania Library and the re~\nlated libraries, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, the\nLibrary Company of Philadelphia and its Ridgewar Branch,\nAmerican Philosophical Society, the Academy of Natural Sciences of\nPhiladelphia, the Franklin Institute, and the Libraries of Bryn\nMawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore, a total, perhaps, of two and a\nhalf to three million cards would have to be reproduced. The\n\ntotal cost of film for this reproduction would not exceed $1,500.\nMachine rental should not exceed $100, including the cost of trans~\nporting the machine from library to library.\n\nA film copy placed in a central depository like the University\nof Pennsylvania Library would temporarily serve the purposes of a\nunion catalog; it would occupy little space and would be convenient\nto use, but more important, it would be a practical step, which\ncould be taken immediately and with little expense, toward the crea~\ntion of a union card catalog.\n\nMaking Positive Prints:\n\nThe Eastman Kodak Company has developed the equipment for\nreproducing positive prints from the master film negative produced\nby the Recordak at a cost which is unquestionably the lowest for\nproducing positive (black on white) copies of library cards. Com~\nparable figures obtainable with a Dexigraph relate to negative\n(white on black) copies; positive copies are almost twice as high\nas negative. In large quantities, such as would be required for\na union catalog of the Philadelphia libraries, the cost per card,\nit is almost certain, would not exceed 1\u00bd\u00a2, and might be as low as\n1\u00a2. The positive prints could be produced with the utmost ex~\npedition and accuracy by the process. As many prints could be\nmade from the master negative as would be desired. The total cost\nof the actual manufacture of 3,000,000 cards should not exceed\n$45,000, and would probably be nearer $35,000.\n\nOnce the positive prints have been made, a series of brief\nsymbols, one for each library which is to be included in the union\ncatalog, could be stamped by cheap labor on the margin of the\ncards. Thereafter the cards would be ready for assembling.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.R.

    "text": "\n\nMEMORANDUM ON TECHNIQUES OF REPRODUCTION\n\nDecember, 1934\n\nThe scholar is both a user and a producer of research\nmaterials. In both of these functions, he has hitherto de~\npended very largely upon the techniques of printing, and the\ninstitutions of commercial publishing, and the library.\nPresent technical developments suggest thet he may have\ngreater freedom in distributing the products of his research\nand in procuring materials for it. The most important tech~\nniques that offer new opportunities supplementary to those\nafforded to present day publishing and library service are\nmicro-copying (reduced scale photography on film), and near-\nprinting (photo-offset from typescript, mimeoform, multigraph,\nmimeograph, and hectograph). Both near-printing and micro-\ncopying can be worked into the practices of scholarship in\nthe exchange of information and material in two ways: (1) by\nimplementing the activities of the individual scholar who may\nuse micro-photography to gather his own materials and near-\nprint to distribute the results of his research with moderate\ncost to himself, and (2) by entering into the organization of\nlibrary service, micro-copying becomes a library service\nwhen libraries can offer micro-copies of their material to\nany scholar at a cost which may be as low as .15 or .25 per\n100 pages on 16 mm. film (or less than the cost of interlibrary\nloan). Near-print and other means of reproducing texts can\nbe fitted into library organization when libraries desiring a\ncertain book can arrange to pro-rate the full cost of bringing\n\n\nit out by the technique appropriate to the number of libraries\nsubscribing. By such a distribution of costs, libraries could\nput on their shelves precisely the materials that the library\nadministration and its advisors on the faculties may desire.\n\nIn pursuit of this general objective, the Joint Committee\non Materials for Research is working to develop more efficient\nphotographic apparatus for micro-copying by individuals or\ninstitutions. It is exploring the possibility of organizing\nfacilities for the distribution of near-print material brought\nout by the individual scholar at his own expense, and is about\nto experiment with a publishing service that will ciroularize\nlibraries to discover the demand for a given work and pro-rate\nthe cost of production among the libraries desiring it.\n\nOne of the greatest obstacles to the free circulation of\nthe materials and products of research and the full utiliza~\ntion of contemporary techniques is psychological. It is the\nattitude of most scholars toward the printed book. It seems\nin some cases that respect for the physical form overshadows\nconsideration of the intellectual content. For scholarly\ndocuments of small circulation, documents that might well be\ncalled the internal documents of scholarship, the same pro~\ncesses that are used in business and government are appro~\npriate -- namely, mimeograph, photo-offset, hectograph, and\nother uses of typescript. Thirty-five percent of the govern~\nment's publications are already issued in near-print form.\nIt is possible that some materials now issued in the form of\n\n\npublished books and magazine articles of a highly special~\nined nature could be more appropriately and more economic~\nally circulated among scholars im near-print form or film,\nand that some things not now published at all might be\nmade available if scholars would accept typescript as the\nintellectual equivalent of print. The editors of several\nscholarly publications here evinced a willingness to review\nnear\u2014printed materials.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Materials for Research invites\nyour attention, thought, and coment upon this approach to\nthe problems of scholarly publication and the organization\nof materials for research.\n\nA brief account of the various new techniques and their\napplication follows:\n\n\n        Micro-copying (reduced scale photography on film):\n\n\n        Institutional:\n\nFor institutions desiring to make micro-copies of mater~\nials, several cameras are available:\n\nThe Recordak, developed commercially for making photo~\ngraphic records of checks and bills, photographs loose sheets\nconsecutively on 16 mm. film with great rapidity. The camera\nis almost wholly automatic in action. The sheets are fed in\none page at a time, very much as sheets are fed into a cylinder\npress or mimeograph. The machine is particularly well suited\nto copying of any loose-leaf materials, such as typewritten\nor long-hand manuscripts, charts, statistical tables, etc.\nSmall pamphlets likewise can be copied without renoving the\nstitches. 256,000 documents relating to the Agricultural Ad~\njustment Administration and the National Recovery Administration\nwere copied by means of the Recordak, as many as 17,000 being\nphotographed in a single day, at an average cost of one-eighth\ncent per page, including cost of film, labor, and machine rental.\n\n\na special Recordak camera has been developed by the Eastman\nKodak Company for copying newspapers. This camera is available\nonly at Rochester, New York. The pages of any issue are photo~\ngraphed consecutively on 35 mm. film. Since the photographing\nof an entire month's edition of a newspaper will require only\nabout thirty minutes, all the work can be done at Rochester. The\ncost per negative is around 10\u00a2 per foot, or 833 pages for $5.50.\n\nA Recordak camera suitable for copying bound material is\nalso being developed by the Eastman Kodak Company. Samples of\nits work are available for display.\n\nA camera suitable for copying bound material has been de~\nveloped also by Dr. R.H. Draeger of the Navy Medical School.\nThis camera, which is on display, has been installed at the\nlibrary of the Department of Agriculture. It can be built to\ntake 16, 35, and 70 mm. film.\n\nBy ordinary reproduction methods, the unit-cost per copy\ntends to decrease greatly as the number of copies increases. In\nfilm copying, however, it costs almost as little to make the\nfirst copy as to make the hundredth copy. Great bodies of re~\nsearch materials -- like the hearings relating to the N.R.A. and\nA.A.A. codes or the cable dispatches received by news agencies\nlike the Associated Press, or the files of a series of the most\nimportant metropolitan newspapers -- can be reproduced on film,\nwhereas their reproduction by any other method would be pro~\nhibitive in cost.\n\nFurther, the cost of reproduction on film diminishes in\ngeometric proportions with photographic reductions. Thus, by\ncutting twelve-point type to a photographic reduction of one\ndiameter, making it the equivalent of six-point type, four times\nthe amount of reading matter can be put on the area of photo~\ngraphic film equivalent to the area of the original. By re~\nducing the A.A.A. and N.R.A. materials 23 diameters, cost levels\nfar below those of other methods of reproduction were attained.\n\nThrough the further introduction of copying cameras in\ngreat central depositories and of equipment for reading the film\ncopies in various libraries throughout the country, research\nmaterials could be made much more mobile. Research libraries\non film could be built up. Through micro-copying, gaps in\nlibrary holdings could be filled, manuscript collections made\ncomplete, newspaper files supplemented, ephemeral material pre~\nserved, and the needs of the individual scholar for specialized\nresearch met.\n\n\n        Individual:\n\nFor the individual scholar's needs in photographic equipment,\nthe Leica equipment and the new Folmer Graflex Copying Camera are\non display.\n\n\n        Near-Print Techniques:\n\n\n        Photo-Offset:\n\nThe photo-offset process is the result of a combined appli~\ncation of the principles of lithography and photography, together\nwith a new type of printing press. A photographic image of the\nmaterial to be reproduced is transferred, via a negative, to a\nthin metal plate, covered with a light-sensitive emulsion. An\nexposure to an arc light hardens the portions of the emulsion\nunder the transparent parts of the negative and so creates on the\nplat an emulsion image of the copy to be reproduced. The emulsion\nis of such a character that it is receptive to greasy ink. The\nplate, therefore, may be placed upon a press which moistens it\nand inks it. The moisture adheres to the parts of the plate not\ncarrying the hardened emulsion, while the greasy ink avoids the\nmoistened survaces of the plate, but sticks to the emulsion image.\nThis plate then prints a reversed image on a rubber blanket with\nwhich it comes in contact, and from this rubber blanket the wet\nimpression is offset on the paper sheet.\n\nThe photo-offset process is essentially a copying process.\nA printed page, a typescript page, a drawing, a paste-up made\nby combining text and illustrations, graphs or tabular matter\nmay serve as copy. Thus rare items, old newspapers, manuscripts,\netc., reduced or enlarged to any size desired, can be easily\nreproduced simply by making a photographic negative of the ma~\nterials. Typewritten pages can serve as master copy for the\nmaking of pre-print text-books. Since photo-offset costs are\ndetermined by plate surface, not by the content within this sur~\nface, a saving proportionate to the photographic reduction of\nthe materials to be reproduced can be effected. An example of\nthis is the publication of the Abstracts of Studies in Education\n      \n\n        at Pennsylvania State College, edited by Professor Charles C.\nPeters, and of A Double Tragedy, produced by Admiral Bradley A.\nFiske, copies of which are on display.\n\n\n\n        Mimeoform:\n\nThe mimeoform process, devised by Dr. Ernest Kletsch of the\nLibrary of Congress, is a combination of multigraphing and ordinary\nprinting. The method of printing employed is that of printing\nfrom raised type. A Lanston monotype is used for setting the type,\nwhich is cast in a low type mold. The caster automatically delivers\nthe line of short type, three-eighths of an inch high, properly\nspaced and justified, to the channels of a multigraph drum. The\ndrum is then placed on a multigraphing machine which forms the\nprinting medium.\n\nThe product of the Mimeoform process is similar to that pro~\nduced by ordinary printing. Print-face is used, italics, and\n\nbold face are possible, the lines are justified, etc. Since\nthe space between the channels on the multigraph drum is\nfixed, not more than six lines per inch are possible, regard~ \nless of the size of type. Footnotes, consequently, are better\ngathered at the end of a chapter. For the reproduction in\nsmall editions of straight textual matter, or bibliographical \nmatter, the mimeograph process is deserving of serious consid~\neration. Samples of the work are on display.\n\n\n        Multigraph, Mimeograph, and Hectograph:\n\nThe multigraph, mimeograph, and hectograph machines are\ndesigned chiefly for office use. The multigraph, a small\nrotary printing machine, is employed chiefly for printing form\nletters and circulars of one or two pages in imitation type~\nscript through an inked ribbon and office forms from print~\nface type with printer's ink. The mimeograph, with which\nscholars are most familiar multiplies typescript by means of\na stencil through which ink is squeezed. The hectograph mul~\ntiplies typescript by picking off in small amounts from a\nmaster text a coloring matter, usually a methyl violet dye\nwhich is transferred to successive sheets. The Standard New\nProcess Duplicator, for which the master text is prepared by\nreversing a carbon to a master sheet which receives a violet\ndye from the carbon through typing, has been found very con~\nvenient to use. This master sheet is easily attached to a\nrotary machine and portions of the dye are dissolved off by\nthe successive sheets which are moistened by alcohol as they\nare fed into the machine.\n\nRobert C.

    "text": "\n\nMEMORANDUM ON DEVELOPMENT OF APPARATUS IN MICROCOPYING\n\nDecember 16, 1935\n\nConferences held in Washington, December 11 and 12 vy various\npersons interested in the development of micro-copying resulted in\nthe following tentative proposals herewith circulated for review,\nand approved on behalf of the Joint Committee on Materials for\nResearch by the Chairman and Executive Secretary.\n\nI\n\nDr. Watson Davis of Science Service has kindly undertaken to\ncirculate memoranda and information on micro-copying to persons\ninterested in the development of the process. This memorandum and\nothers will therefore be cleared through him.\n\nII\n\nThe most difficult problem now confronting thie nascent in~\ndustry is that of design of projectors. The essentials are that\nthe projectors to be designed and put on the market shall be adapted\nas much as may be technically possible to the reading of micro~\ncopies that may originate from all possible sources.\n\nIII\n\nThere are three media of micro-copying, to be considered:\npaper, 35mm. film and 16mm. film. Since the use of paper does not\ninvolve the need for a projector, it can be considered separately,\nbut the great convenience in filing paper micro-copies as compared\nwith film, and the relative cheapness of paper as against film,\nindicate that paper must not be ignored in the micro-copying problem.\nDr. Bendikson of the Huntington Library, Dr. Dallas Irvine of the\nNational Archives, and the Folmer Graflex Corporation in the develop~\nment of their new copying camera are among those who have most care~\nfully thought out the possibilities of micro-copying on paper.\n\nIV\n\nRelated to the distinction between the 16mm. and the 35mm.\nfilm, but not identical with the problem of the choice of film\nwidth, is the problem of reduction ratio on film for projection.\n\n\n\nThe International Filmbook Corporation and the Recordak Corporation \nand the Recordak newspaper copying enterprises contemplate the use \nof 35mm. film with a high reduction retio (16 to 23 diameters, or \nover). Such high reduction ratios are also to be used on 16mm. film.\nLower reduction ratios are developed by users of the Leica camera\nand by the Biblio Film Service of the Department of Agriculture, \nwhich uses the Draeger camera, especially in connection with the \nmicro-copying of short items. Any reading equipment can easily be \nequipped with reel-holding devices that will take either 16mm or\n35mm. film, and it should be a rule that designers are not encouraged\nto develop apparatus that will not permit the use of either width of \nfilm. In connection with he problem of enlargement ratio, a differ~\nent situation exists. \n\nV\n\nProjecting equipment, granted that it is adapted to both 16mm.\nand 35mm. film, will vary in the following essential particulars:\n\na. It may be fixed focus or variable focus. The Recordak\nequipment has a fixed enlarging ratio of 22 diameters.\nThe projective Folmer Graflex equipment will have a varying\nenlargement ratio that can be set at will. Each of these\nmethods has its advantages and disadvantages.\n\nb. Some reading equipment throws the imege on a screen from\nwhich it 1s reflected back to the eye; other equipment\nthrows the image through a semi-translucent screen. The\nRecordak and Folmer Graflex will be of the first type. The\ntranslucent reading machines will be the International\nFilmbook apparatus, the Draeger projection reader, possibly\nthe machine put on sale by the Leitz Company, and possibly\nthe machine to be developed by the Spencer Lens Company.\n\nc. Reading machines differ in the size of aperture; that is to\nsay, in the amount of film they will enlarge for reading\nat one time. The Leica projector takes a double frame of\n35mm. film, 1\" x 1\u00bd\". The aperture of the Spencer Lens\nCompany projector now contemplated will be a single frame,\n\u00be\" x 1\"; that of the Recordak is one-quarter of a frame;\nand that of the International Filmbook Corporation may be\neven less. In general, there is a relationship between\nsize of aperture and enlargement power, because if the\naperture is only one-quarter of a frame it will not permit\nthe reading of lines of print that have been micro-copied\nto extend across the full width of 35mm. film.\n\nVI\n\nMaterial that has been micro-copied on 16mm. film at a high\nreduction ratio can be printed off on 35mm. film at a lower reduction\nratio; material that has been micro-copied on 25mm. film at a low\n\n\n\nreduction ratio can be copied off on 16mm. film at a high reduction\nratio. This fact is of vital importanoe because it permits the\npurchaser of a low power projecting apparatus to order copies of\nany long run of 16mm. high reduction film (as the NRA and AAA\nrecords) in a form that he can read. Conversely, the purchaser of \na small aperture, high reduction ratio projector can utilize mater~\nial that was originally copied with a low reduction ratio on 35mm.\nfilm, if he has it printed off on the reduced size.\n\nVII\n\nTaking into account the foregoing facts and possibilities, it \nwould appear that the following developments in projection apparatus\ncan be integrated into a common system and so arranged that the\nproducts of any micro-copying enterprise could be made available\nto the projectors of any apparatus, with a few exceptions that will\nbe noted:\n\na. Double frame aperture, low enlarging pwwer -- Leica\n(now available but costly).\n\nb. Single frame aperture, fixed focus, 14 diameter\nenlarging power, reading by transmitted light --\nunder development by Dr. Draeger.\n\nc. One-half frame aperture, 22 diameter enlarging\npower, fixed focus, reading by reflected light --\nRecordak apparatus.\n\nd. Vartiable aperture, variable enlarging power, reading\nby reflected light -- Folmer Graflex machine.\n\ne. One-quarter frame aperture, very high enlarging power,\nfixed focus, transmitted light -- International\nFilmbook Corporation development.\n\nVIII\n\nLarge-scale copying enterprises, such as the proposed micro-\ncopying of books published prior to 1640, can be made on either\n35mm. or 16mm. film, either at a high reduction ratio (as 16, 20, 23)\nor a low reduction ratio (as 9 to 14 diameters). If the master copy\nis made in a low reduction ratio, the possessors of Recordak or\nInternational Filmbook apparatus would merely purchase their film in\na reduction on 16mm. film. If the original is made at a high re~\nduction ratio on 16mm. film, the possessors of the Draeger, Leica,\nand presumably Folmer Graflex apparatus would purchase it in the\nenlarged form on 25mm. film. The newspaper material now being\nby the Recordak Corporation in a reduction of 16 diameters can be\nread presumably on any one of four reading machines: the Draeger\n\n\nprojector will enlarge it back 14 diameters, at some loss of legi~\nbility, but it will show the full width of the newspaper page; the\nRecordak projector will show only one-quarter of a page, but enlarge\nit above original size; the International Filmbook machines will\npresumably show less than one-quarter of the area of the newspaper\npage, but may give it even more enlargement than the Recordak;\nFolder Graflex can presumably be adapted to the reading of this\ntype of film. Micro-copies produced like the NRA and AAA series can\nbe read presumably directly and without change on the Recordak\nInternational Filmbook and Folmer Graflex equipment. For reading \non the Draeger, Leica and Spencer Lens projectors, they would be \nreproduced for the purchaser in 35mm. width, making the reduction\nequivalent to 11\u00bd diameters rather than 23 diameters. The short\nstrips of film now being distributed by the Biblio Film Service in\nreductions of 9 or 10 diameters can presumably be read on all \nprojection apparatus except that of the International Filmbook\nCorporation, and doubtless if special instructions are given for\nthe filming of such strips by the Blblio Film Service they can be\nadapted even to the International Filmbook projector.\n\nIX\n\n\nConclusion: it is submitted that this array of equipment will\nprovide for the reading of any film now being used, or likely to be\nused, with present techniques, except such copies made at very high\nreduction on multiple exposure on 35mm. film. Such copies would\nbe legible only in the Recordak and International Filmbook apparatus.\n\nThe recipients of this memorandum are invited to communicate\ntheir views upon it to Dr. Watson Davis of Science Service and Dr.\nRobert C. Binkley, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Materials\nfor Research. Those who are especially interested in the possi~\nbilities of micro-copying on paper are invited to write also to\nDr. Dallas Irvine at the National Archives.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "\n\nMemorandum on Simplified Research Techniques\n\nDecember 16, 1935\n\nThis memorandum is a continuation and integration of three lines\nof thought that have developed in the course of the work of the Joint\nCommittee on Materials for Research: (a) the idea of the restoration\nof \"amateur scholarship\" as stated in the memorandum on New Tools, New\nRecruits for the Republic of Letters, which has already been circulated\nto the members of the Joint Committee; (b) the experience with the set~\nting up of Works Progress Administration research projects, the character\nof which is indicated in a letter from Mr. Jacob Baker, Assistant Admin~\nistrator of the Works Progress Administration; (c) a discussion on Dec~\nember 12 in the office of the American Council of Learned Societies on\nbroad matters of policy, with Dr. Leland, Dr. Mortimer Graves, Dr. T.R. \nSchellenberg, and Robert C. Binkley; Miss Barry acted as secretary.\n\nI.\n\nIt is proposed that a study be made of simplified research tech~\nniques to the end that there may be a better distribution of labor in\nscholarship to accord with the varied capacities of individuals to do\nresearch work, the varied degree to which individuals are free to con~\ncentrate their time upon research work, and the varied availability of\nmaterials for research.\n\nII.\n\nSuch a development of simplified research techniques should in~\ncrease the actual working personnel of American scholarship by drawing\nmore fully into it the following types of workers: (a) university, college,\nand high school teachers who, because of limitations of time, materials,\nor training, are not able to keep the pace set by the most advanced re~\nsearch workers; (b) college graduates not engaged in any academic pro~\nfession, but having at their disposal time and interest, and in some\ncases, money, that can be devoted to scholarly purposes.\n\nIII.\n\nThe possibility of utilizing simplified research techniques is the\nresult of development in methods of reproducing research materials, which\nhave the following consequences: (a) near-print reproductions made at\nlow cost will circulate materials or products of research to limited num~\nbers of scholars or research institutions without incurring the costs or\nrisks of publication; (b) micro-copying, by making it possible to duplicate\nat very low cost any organized collection of data, has extinguished the\n\ndistinction hitherto so vital between collection of materials for re~\nsearch and their publication. Any degree of preparation that can be\ngiven to research materials by any workers, whether it be the mere\ncollection of documents, the organization of documetns, or the drawing\nof preliminary conclusions from original data, can be made available\non demand to research workers at one step higher in the intellectual \nhierarchy, without great cost.\n\nIV.\n\nThe explorations of the Joint Committee have shown that in all\nprobability present resources of scholarship, personal and financial,\nare not adequate to preserve, organize, and develop the full corpus of\nmaterials that should be in hand as the record of our civilization.\n\nV.\n\nEducation: the schism in the intellectual world that resulted from\nthe preoccupation of those interested in pedagogy with methods of in~\nstruction at the expense of content of learning, and of research workers\nin content at the expense of methods of instruction, has not strengthened\nbut has rather weakened American intellectual life. It has resulted in\na situation in which the teaching career, especially in the secondary\nschool, is made less attractive in terms of intellectual dignity than it\nwould need to be. It would seem that a good teacher at any level in the\nschool system could teach more effectively if she were able to illustrate\ngeneralizations in history, social studies, or other fields from local\nand familiar instances. But such illustrations presuppose a sound in~\nvestigation of the local data in its relation to the general findings of\na discipline; and if such an investigation is made, its result is more\nthan teaching material; it is, in fact, an additional datum in the induc~\ntive structure of the discipline.\n\nVI.\n\nAdult education: an objective of adult education is to continue the\neducational process beyond the period of schooling, and to make it a\npermanent part of a well rounded life. Some of the effort that is in~\nvolved in the program of adult education can perhaps be made useful not\nalone to those adults who are the object of the process, but also to the\nfield of scholarship in which their interests lie.\n\nVII.\n\nA study of this problem need not interfere in any way with the de~\nvelopment of equally important plans for recruiting more men of genius\nof the scholarly world and freeing them for more effective labor; rather\nit will supplement efforts to develop higher scholarship by fostering the\ncollection of more data upon which such highly gifted individuals can\nwork, and by broadening the numbers from whom they may be selected.\n\nVIII.\n\nThe experience of the Works Progress Administration, in its white-\ncollar projects department, had been a challenge to the American academ~\nic work which has not been fully met. As might have been predicted,\nthere were not many enterprises of scholarly value which could be under~\ntaken with present research technique by individuals of high school\neducation or its equivalent. The opportunity was presented to the scholarly\nworld to devise some way of providing the labor in scholarship that would\nmake the directed and disciplined efforts of large groups of people of\nthis type useful. The present work under way in such enterprises as the\nFederal Writers' Projects should be studied carefully to draw from it any\nlessons it may hold on the feasibility of new divisions of labor in\nscholarship.\n\nIX.\nThe first step to be taken in this direction should be, perhaps, an\nexploratory conference, to be attended not only by a few well-chosen\nleaders and well-chosen research scholars, but also by some people who\nwill represent the interests of education from the secondary to the adult level.\n\nRobert C. Binkley\n\nChairman, Joint Committee\non Materials for Research\n\n\n"

    "text": "\n\nJanuary 10, 1936\n\nThe Joint Committee on Materials for Research takes pleasure in informing\nyou that the Works Progress Administration has developed a project for the in~\nventory of state and local archives. This project promises to contribute de~\ncisively to the improvement of materials for research in America. It is being\norganized along lines projected in past years by the Public Archives Committee\nof the American Historical Association and by the Joint Committee on Materials\nfor Research. It calls for the expenditure of approximately $1,200,000 by June\n30th, and it will be administered by the Federal Writers' Projects.\n\nThe Joint Committee is anxious to have the full cooperation of historians\nand other persons interested in the preservation and proper utilization of the\ntreasures which lie hidden in the records of local units and is therefore re~\nquesting you to indicate to the National Supervisor of the Historical Records\nSurvey your interest in this program and your willingness to assist in making it\na success. It is particularly desired by the Joint Committee that you indicate\nto the National Supervisor whatever suggestions you may have concerning the scope\nof the project in your state. The National Supervisor is also interested in hav~\ning full statements of the progress which has already been made in each state\nandd locality in the inventory of public records and other historical materials.\n\nThe National Supervisor of this project is Dr. Luther H. Evans, for the\npast five years Assistant Professor of Politics at Princeton University. The\nJoint Committee assures you that his point of view coincides with that of ar~\nchival and historical experts. The Joint Committee is glad to give him its full\nsupport, and sincerely hopes that you will do tha same.\n\nThe principal task to be undertaken by the Historical Records Survey is\nthe listing of the records of state and county governments. In some cases, how~\never, it is understood that municipal and other local unit records will be in~\nventoried. Plans are also being drafted for the preparation of general descrip~\ntions of manuscript collections throughout the country. These will necessarily\nhave to be brief, but it is hoped that a general guide to manuscript collections\ncan be prepared by the survey. In this importent work, it is believed that very\nvaluable assistance can be rendered by the custodians of such collections, and\nalso by research people who have worked in them.\n\nThe Joint Committee or the National Supervisor of the Historical Records\nSurvey will be glad to furnish you any further information which you may desire\nconcerning this project.\n\nThe National Supervisor is Dr. Luther H. Evans, 1500 Eye Street, Washington\nD.C.\n\nRobert C. Binkley, Chairman\nJoint Committee on Materials for Research\n\n\n"
