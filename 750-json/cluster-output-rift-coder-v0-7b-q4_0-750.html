The Joint Committee on Materials for Research has in mind an experiment. 
It proposes to issue research papers and theses not through printing, but 
through near-print reproduction processes such as mimeographing or multilithography. 
These techniques are cheaper than printing and offer the advantage of being able 
to reproduce any document exactly as it is written without alteration. The use of these 
techniques will also make available to librarians and researchers a tangible gift, since 
they can handle such materials directly. This experiment has particular interest in view 
of the fact that many products of research are internal documents of scholarship which should not be 
circulated as if they were intended for a wide reading public. The Joint Committee on 
Materials for Research invites suggestions from librarians and other members concerning this 
experiment, in particular about the best near-print reproduction processes to be used and how 
to handle the materials so produced.

The Joint Committee on Materials for Research is interested in experiments in the use of techniques 
other than printing as a means of circulating the products of research among scholars. Many 
products of research are, in effect, internal documents of scholarship. They should not be circulated 
as if they were to be useful to a wide reading public. The Joint Committee on Materials for Research 
proposes to issue research papers and theses not through printing, but through near-print reproduction 
processes such as mimeographing or multilithography. These techniques are cheaper than printing and offer

(a) a high-power lens, (b) an enlargement of the image to
about two inches on a screen not less than three feet from
the lens, and (c) a means of focusing the light from the
objective lens onto this screen. The latter is being worked
up by Dr. J. H. Carr at Columbia University with an arrangement
of mirrors which will be published in a forthcoming paper. 
The former two are to be considered in another memorandum.
A list of patents and copyrights, both foreign and domestic,
involving micro-copying is being prepared by Dr. Davis for the
Committee's use. It will also include a report on photographic
paper suitable for this purpose. The latter has been under
experimentation at Columbia University since 1932 with results
that are satisfactory, and it seems to be practicable as an
alternative to the present system of making copies on film.
The paper is not a duplicate of photographic paper but
a new kind of paper which does not contain any metallic salts. 
It has excellent contrast with light and dark. It is being
studied by Dr. H. C. Schaefer, Professor of Physics at the
University of Illinois, who also has been experimenting with a
special lens for micro-copying. The work in progress on this
paper is to determine its suitability for use in making copies 
of books and other materials which are not large enough to be
used as motion picture film.

Dr. Davis also proposes that the Joint Committee on Materials
for Research submit a request to Mr. Vanneveld of Bell Labs,
New York City, for a list of all patents in the United States </li>
        
            <li><a href="#cluster_4">Cluster 4</a> (2 memos): 
            ives for preservation purposes. The agency should 
be located as near as possible to the newspaper indexer's office.
The negatives themselves need not be returned.

4. That a separate microfilm copy of each issue, or such parts
of an issue as are to be indexed, be made for use in indexing
the file and in checking offsets against other files. 

5. The microfilmed pages should be processed through the
Newspaper Indexing Equipment (NIE) designed by WPA.  </li>

        be substantial employment in private industry, the newspaper
industry must be preserved and developed for its present
role as a source of information. The other alternative is that
the number of unemployed will increase so greatly that they
will form an important part of our social problem. In either case, 
        it is necessary to make this industry more than ever before
a matter of public concern and interest.

The newspaper index serves as a means for the first time
of making available such information in ways not previously known.
It will provide scholars with an almost unlimited source of data
for research, but it also offers a new way of thinking about
the past. The result is that we have entered upon a new era 
        wherein thought and action are no longer separated. It has been 
        said that the end of the twentieth century will see an explosion 
        in scholarly research which hitherto was impossible, owing to 
        the lack of available sources of information. The newspaper 
        index is a key to this new era and its utility as a source 
        of information is rapidly being recognized by scholars all 
        over the world.

The first step in using the Newspaper Index was the realization 
        that there were two types of entries: (1) those newspaper 
articles which are already held in the Library of Congress and 
(2) those articles which are not, but could be micro-copied from 
the files. The latter class is a large one, and to make this 
information available for research requires either that each 
article be separately catalogued (a task which would consume 
about two years of labor at present rates) or else that the articles 
already in print be micro-copied from their original files. The 
former plan</li>

The number of enterprises in union catalogue work has greatly in~
creased available information as to the place of the union catalogue
system in the research resources of this country. The possible function
of union catalogues in the national library system is being altered not
only by the development of micro-copying in lieu of lending of books,
periodical articles, etc. controlled in a union catalogue, but by pos~
sible inexpensive micro-copying of the union catalogues themselves.
Estimates of prices at which micro-copies of union catalogues could be
distributed go as low as $50.00 per one million entries. The possibil~
ity appears, moreover, that the full subject catalogues of certain </p>

                        <p>The Sub-Committee should endeavor to develop a
consciousness of the problem of the search for new materials.
Scholars are quite aware of the importance of studying facts,
but they do not vizualize the task of discovering and utiliz~
ing materials not already in use. The imagination of the
scholar has hardly reached this realm of endeavor. In a gen~
eral way, this is the most important task.</p>

gone far enough, so that we have some definite material

            <div class="summary">~

The Joint Committee on Materials for Research has in mind an experiment. 
It proposes to issue research papers and theses not through printing, but 
through near-print reproduction processes such as mimeographing or multilithography. 
These techniques are cheaper than printing and offer the advantage of being able 
to reproduce any document exactly as it is written without alteration. The use of these 
techniques will also make available to librarians and researchers a tangible gift, since 
they can handle such materials directly. This experiment has particular interest in view 
of the fact that many products of research are internal documents of scholarship which should not be 
circulated as if they were intended for a wide reading public. The Joint Committee on 
Materials for Research invites suggestions from librarians and other members concerning this 
experiment, in particular about the best near-print reproduction processes to be used and how 
to handle the materials so produced.

                        <p>A typescript thesis is a "rare book". From the standpoint of
library administration it is nothing else. Micro-copying that
will make rare books available will make typescript theses avail~

                        <p>The special problem in making these theses available to
users is no longer mechanical, but has to do with bibliographical

about two inches on a screen not less than three feet from
the lens, and (c) a means of focusing the light from the
objective lens onto this screen. The latter is being worked
up by Dr. J. H. Carr at Columbia University with an arrangement
of mirrors which will be published in a forthcoming paper. 
The former two are to be considered in another memorandum.
A list of patents and copyrights, both foreign and domestic,
involving micro-copying is being prepared by Dr. Davis for the
Committee's use. It will also include a report on photographic
paper suitable for this purpose. The latter has been under
experimentation at Columbia University since 1932 with results
that are satisfactory, and it seems to be practicable as an
alternative to the present system of making copies on film.
The paper is not a duplicate of photographic paper but
a new kind of paper which does not contain any metallic salts. 
It has excellent contrast with light and dark. It is being
studied by Dr. H. C. Schaefer, Professor of Physics at the
University of Illinois, who also has been experimenting with a
special lens for micro-copying. The work in progress on this
paper is to determine its suitability for use in making copies 
of books and other materials which are not large enough to be
used as motion picture film.

                        <p>Microphotography is not an end in itself but a means to
an end; ample library resources are not ends in themselves
but means to an end; the same is true of the free flow of do~

mon object is that scholars may read what they went to read
when they want to read it, and may communicate to each other
what they want to write when they choose to write it.</p>
                    
                        <p>Just where does microphotography fit into this picture?
It is one of a number of mechanical techniques supplementary
to printing (including non—edition, full-size publication by

        be substantial employment in private industry, the newspaper
industry must be preserved and developed for its present
role as a source of information. The other alternative is that
the number of unemployed will increase so greatly that they
will form an important part of our social problem. In either case, 
        it is necessary to make this industry more than ever before
a matter of public concern and interest.

The newspaper index serves as a means for the first time
of making available such information in ways not previously known.
It will provide scholars with an almost unlimited source of data
for research, but it also offers a new way of thinking about
the past. The result is that we have entered upon a new era 
        wherein thought and action are no longer separated. It has been 
        said that the end of the twentieth century will see an explosion 
        in scholarly research which hitherto was impossible, owing to 
        the lack of available sources of information. The newspaper 
        index is a key to this new era and its utility as a source 
        of information is rapidly being recognized by scholars all 
        over the world.

The first step in using the Newspaper Index was the realization 
        that there were two types of entries: (1) those newspaper 
articles which are already held in the Library of Congress and 
(2) those articles which are not, but could be micro-copied from 
the files. The latter class is a large one, and to make this 
information available for research requires either that each 
article be separately catalogued (a task which would consume 
about two years of labor at present rates) or else that the articles 
already in print be micro-copied from their original files. The 
former plan</div>

item indexed to permit the consultant to decide whether or not he wants to
go to the file. The information given must be an absolute minimum for
purpose.</p>

controlled by micro-copying; (2) the distribution of the files among de~
positories, which renders travel more necessary in the use of this mater~
by scholars than in the use of book or periodical material. To the
extent that micro-copying is combined with adequate long-term lending
conditions 1 and 2 are rectified. (3) The heterogeneous character of the
contents, which can be controlled by calendaring, digesting, or indexing
operations.</p>

more nearly complete than any other single type of record. The news~

ject matter. They are at once the bulkiest, the rarest, the most
inaccessible, and the most impermanent of our library holdings. If
they disappear by reason of the fact that they are printed on highly
perishable paper, the whole period of American history from the Civil
War to the Depression will become a kind of Dark Ages for historical
research.</p>
