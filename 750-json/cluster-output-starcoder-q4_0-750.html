3) some means to reduce film by sixteen diameters without distorti~
on or damage. These requirements have been met with considerable
effort in recent years at various laboratories of optical physics, but
the problem is still unsolved. The present state of technology does not
permit the production of a projector which will reduce film by sixteen
diameters without distortion and damage to the image or print. It may be
possible with improved lenses; it has been suggested that an apparatus
could be constructed in which photographic equipment is used for rea~
ding microfilm, but this requires a great deal of additional equipm~

1) A good wide-angle lens: The best available projectors are those
which have very large focal lengths. 250mm., say, would make the most
convenient lenses; and 360mm. is not unusual for photographic equipment.


4) An appropriate light source: Lighting should be such that a~
photograph of any given page can be read with no distortion or damage to it

5) Some means by which film may be reduced sixteen diameters without
distortion and damage to the image or print: The best way is probably
to use photographic equipment. This requires an apparatus for reducing a
photograph of any page into microfilm, but this can now be obtained at
a low cost from laboratories in optical physics (see Memorandum on Photogra~

1. A newspaper index must give enough information about each item indexed to permit the consultant to decide whether or not he wants to go to the file. The information given must be an absolute minimum for purpose.


2. Since the consultant is assumed to use the file whenever
he uses the index, provisions for immediate or ultimate micro-copying of 
the file should be a part of the plan.

3. The procedure used in making the New York Times Index cannot
be followed in WPA's office because they do not have access to the files themselves and therefore can't make any changes that would affect their index entries.

MEMORANDUM ON NEWSPAPER POLICY

205

The New York Times Index is an example of a well-made newspaper inde~
x which has been made with the utmost care and attention to detail. It
is not only complete, but it also contains all the information that one
might need for any given research question; indeed, its contents are so
well organized as to permit an untrained person to find what he wants in a
few minutes of studying. The index is arranged alphabetically by newspaper name and then by date (the latter being the most important). In addition it contains information about each article which will help researchers decide whether or not they want to go see that particular issue, as well as what other issues might be interesting in comparison with this one.

The New York Times Index is a very good example of an index made for
the use of scholars who are unfamiliar with the subject matter and its
organizational features but whose knowledge of English is sufficient to
understand how it can help them find what they want, even</li>

and micro-copying are in themselves new modes of production;~
but they can be applied as supplementary to existing forms o~
f publishing and library service, and even with those for which
they have not yet been invented (e.g., photocopy). The advan~
tages that these techniques offer over the old ones are many-
fold:

1. Microphotography can be done in any medium or system of
   recording, whether it is a conventional film cartridge; an
   offset microfilm on paper tape (with special hardware); o~
   r even by means of photoelectric inkjet printing directly from
   the computer screen. It need not require expensive equipment
   and facilities to produce.

work of the sub-committee on categories of material:</p>

                        <p>The Sub-Committee should endeavor to develop a
consciousness of the problem of the search for new materials.
Scholars are quite aware of the importance of studying facts,
but they do not vizualize the task of discovering and utiliz~
ing materials not already in use. The imagination of the
scholar has hardly reached this realm of endeavor. In a gen~
eral way, this is the most important task.</p>

agencies to discover, preserve, and make available any

the care of that category and the policies of destruc~

Archives organization to lay down carefully-studied
policies in respect of all federal archives. The
local and state archives are a relatively unstudied
field, which has now been ripened for careful policy-
making. Enough of the inventory of county archives
has been completed, and work with the state archives
gone far enough, so that we have some definite material
with which to work. Moreover, the Historical Records

            <div class="summary">1) a good,
wide-angle lens; 2) an appropriate light source for the microfilm; and

3) some means to reduce film by sixteen diameters without distorti~
on or damage. These requirements have been met with considerable
effort in recent years at various laboratories of optical physics, but
the problem is still unsolved. The present state of technology does not
permit the production of a projector which will reduce film by sixteen
diameters without distortion and damage to the image or print. It may be
possible with improved lenses; it has been suggested that an apparatus
could be constructed in which photographic equipment is used for rea~
ding microfilm, but this requires a great deal of additional equipm~

1) A good wide-angle lens: The best available projectors are those
which have very large focal lengths. 250mm., say, would make the most
convenient lenses; and 360mm. is not unusual for photographic equipment.


4) An appropriate light source: Lighting should be such that a~
photograph of any given page can be read with no distortion or damage to it

5) Some means by which film may be reduced sixteen diameters without
distortion and damage to the image or print: The best way is probably
to use photographic equipment. This requires an apparatus for reducing a
photograph of any page into microfilm, but this can now be obtained at
a low cost from laboratories in optical physics (see Memorandum on Photogra~

The number of enterprises in union catalogue work has greatly in~
creased available information as to the place of the union catalogue
system in the research resources of this country. The possible function
of union catalogues in the national library system is being altered not
only by the development of micro-copying in lieu of lending of books,
periodical articles, etc. controlled in a union catalogue, but by pos~
sible inexpensive micro-copying of the union catalogues themselves.
Estimates of prices at which micro-copies of union catalogues could be
distributed go as low as $50.00 per one million entries. The possibil~

deserve serious consideration. By the use of this equipment, a

MEMORANDUM ON NEWSPAPER POLICY

The New York Times Index is an example of a well-made newspaper inde~
x which has been made with the utmost care and attention to detail. It
is not only complete, but it also contains all the information that one
might need for any given research question; indeed, its contents are so
well organized as to permit an untrained person to find what he wants in a
few minutes of studying. The index is arranged alphabetically by newspaper name and then by date (the latter being the most important). In addition it contains information about each article which will help researchers decide whether or not they want to go see that particular issue, as well as what other issues might be interesting in comparison with this one.

The New York Times Index is a very good example of an index made for
the use of scholars who are unfamiliar with the subject matter and its
organizational features but whose knowledge of English is sufficient to
understand how it can help them find what they want, even</div>

                        <p>Newspapers constitute a category of material widely utilized
in research. Three characteristics call for the attention of this com~
mittee: (1) The high perishability of the files themselves, which can be
controlled by micro-copying; (2) the distribution of the files among de~
positories, which renders travel more necessary in the use of this mater~
by scholars than in the use of book or periodical material. To the
extent that micro-copying is combined with adequate long-term lending
conditions 1 and 2 are rectified. (3) The heterogeneous character of the
contents, which can be controlled by calendaring, digesting, or indexing
operations.</p>

                        <p>The record of our culture contained in our newspaper files is
more nearly complete than any other single type of record. The news~
paper files of the country contain more words than all the printed
books in the Library of Congress, and there is no guide to their sub~
ject matter. They are at once the bulkiest, the rarest, the most
inaccessible, and the most impermanent of our library holdings. If
they disappear by reason of the fact that they are printed on highly
perishable paper, the whole period of American history from the Civil
War to the Depression will become a kind of Dark Ages for historical
research.</p>

and micro-copying are in themselves new modes of production;~
but they can be applied as supplementary to existing forms o~
f publishing and library service, and even with those for which
they have not yet been invented (e.g., photocopy). The advan~
tages that these techniques offer over the old ones are many-
fold:

1. Microphotography can be done in any medium or system of
   recording, whether it is a conventional film cartridge; an
   offset microfilm on paper tape (with special hardware); o~
   r even by means of photoelectric inkjet printing directly from
   the computer screen. It need not require expensive equipment
   and facilities to produce.

                        <p>Microphotography is not an end in itself but a means to
an end; ample library resources are not ends in themselves
but means to an end; the same is true of the free flow of do~
cumentation. The end that all these things have as their com~
mon object is that scholars may read what they went to read
when they want to read it, and may communicate to each other
what they want to write when they choose to write it.</p>
                    
                        <p>Just where does microphotography fit into this picture?
It is one of a number of mechanical techniques supplementary
to printing (including non—edition, full-size publication by

and small edition near-print). The essential</p>

                        <p>The scholar is both a user and a producer of research
materials. In both of these functions, he has hitherto de~
pended very largely upon the techniques of printing, and the
institutions of commercial publishing, and the library.
Present technical developments suggest thet he may have
greater freedom in distributing the products of his research
and in procuring materials for it. The most important tech~
niques that offer new opportunities supplementary to those
afforded to present day publishing and library service are
micro-copying (reduced scale photography on film), and near-
printing (photo-offset from typescript, mimeoform, multigraph,
mimeograph, and hectograph). Both near-pr</p>
