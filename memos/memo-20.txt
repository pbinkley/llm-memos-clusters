To the Members of the Joint Committee:

Recurrently through the years we have raised the
question of policy in destruction of records. A re~
port on business records gives us some guidance as to
the care of that category and the policies of destruc~
tion to be followed there. We can trust the National
Archives organization to lay down carefully-studied
policies in respect of all federal archives. The
local and state archives are a relatively unstudied
field, which has now been ripened for careful policy-
making. Enough of the inventory of county archives
has been completed, and work with the state archives
gone far enough, so that we have some definite material
with which to work. Moreover, the Historical Records
Survey hae compiled, in connection with its inventory
work, the legislation now on the statute books of the
states covering the care and destruction of state, local
records.

Is the time not now ripe for us to approach our
Parent Councils to ask them to sponsor a study of this
kind?

I understand that Dr. Ernest Posner, one-time
archivist of the Berlin Staatsarchiv and now in disfavor
in Germany, would be an ideal person to bring to this
problem a broad knowledge of archival practice, and that
he would be able to put himself into contact with schol~
ars in all fields of learning pertinent to this question
and to translate their needs into practical policies on
preservation and destruction. A brief exploratory dis~
cussion has suggested that $10,000, available as a three-
year grant at $3000 a year plus $1000 expenses, would
procure thisman's services for this job. Should we not
consider this, or some other appropriate action, at the
next meeting of the Joint Committee?


I have been informed, though unofficially, that the
Problems and Policy Committee has endorsed our request
for $10,000 to study union Cataloguing. Do we not feel
that the archival problem is equally ripe for study at
time?
